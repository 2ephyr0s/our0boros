Some may be absurd, impractical or downright insane. But we're talking about beings who don't obey common sense or believe in human logic. Or are confined to the 3rd dimension.</p></div>

## As a note

**Entities are assumed to exist as abstract forms that non-localized and non-temporal. They are assumed to be of multidimensional matter and know of specific forms of intelligence. They carry no known biological nor chemical matter.**

Entities belonging in the Nth dimension are restricted to only act within confines of dimensions N and smaller. However, lesser dimension entities may not be able to interact with beings of higher dimensions, now should they be able to comprehend their existence.

To be able to physically act within a lower dimension, an entity of higher dimension must seek to conform within the rules of the lower dimension. One must go through a *dimensional core shift* via various means in order to conform.

### Dimensional core shift

It is the methodology used by certain iterations to conform into a lower dimension. These methods may fall into certain categories, such as:
1. Mathematical
2. Psychological
3. Biological
4. Transmutation
5. Fragmentation

Some methods may fall into one or more categories. **The key aim of this method is for the entity to be able to interact with a lower dimension to however means.**

Despite the term 'dimensional', some methods do not necessarily include transforming into something of nD physicality (where n < N).

## Outline of known methods
1. Possessing a corpse (which is 3d)
2. Linear (or non-linear I'm not quite sure) transformation
	- see [[LinearTransformationPrinciple]] for more details
3. Alchemy style -- creating a human body
4. Influencing human thought Ã  la brainwashing or mind control
5. Splitting themselves into multiple 3 dimensional pieces
