## Script

[...]

As much as they claim that I am their star student, it couldn't be further from the truth.

They paraded me like some sort of... animal. Like I'm their fucking show pony. Their diversity pick, the outlier, the kid from the outside who is actually capable and not like the crap they instill onto children's heads.

It's kinda fucked up how they force children to view "outsiders" as some broken products. But whatever.

[...]

They had me and a few others be part of the "special needs" group. We have our own class, basically. Segregated from the main school.

Our class is... not actually called "special needs". The academy uses the term "special scholars" to mask the fact that they are marginalizing children who don't fit their idealized "scholars". It's also probably so that they can spin the story however the fuck they want. Make us look special or whatever.

The school body bought it. At least most of them do. Especially when we, "special scholars" are fucking drilled in our heads that we are performing much better than the average classes in our batch, that we are "one of a kind".

The same story might be parroted to other classes. A bloody play on statistics and numbers.

To be fair, we are scoring much better than average. It's really because they dumbed down our fucking material, curved out scores, and barely test us based on actual merit.

Us "special scholars" are purposefully ousted from the main school body, evicted from the school hierarchy in general, and treated like we are kids when we shouldn't be.

They wrote my scripts. In fact, I would never be able to write scripts as structured or as verbose, especially at my previous writing and speaking level.

I spent most of my elementary to middle school on free online courses and at the library. Most of my studies require reading, so I did force myself to gain reading skills and the ability to do tests. My ability to write, however, is severely diminished. I took up mostly STEM courses for their worth in society. Can't say the same about my ability to argue clearly, however.

My skills in communication extend to concise messages, negotiating, and threats. All that is necessary for survival on the streets. Can't say I have the skill in long speeches, the art of persuasion, or structured arguments. Can't even write a proper script for fucks sake. Hell, some of the fancier words I can't even pronounce properly!

It was quite clear for the students in my class that my speech in the 2nd week was written for me. Or to those who didn't catch on, would've known once I told them the truth the next day. It was a load of crap. Hell even that time I had no fucking clue what I was saying.

[...]

A lot of the remaining school year is us as a class grappling with the fact we're cheated on actual education. We started learning material ourselves, proactively starting study groups and shit. Attending cram schools, hiring teachers, and finding material. All without the school knowing.

It's fucking tough. It's also when we started realizing that a lot of information is weirdly censored. And how, for some reason, certain ideals are echoed a fucking lot.

[...]

One of the benefits of our curriculum is probably that we don't get taught the politics of our world as much.

We are essentially doomed to fail. We are set that so once we graduate, we won't have the knowledge to contribute to meaningful work. Large corporations, government positions, research and labs, they all won't accept us with our current knowledge.

We are essentially destined to be the average salary-men whose only worth is to punch numbers and follow orders. Orders we will be too dumb to disobey, clearly.

It's not like we are trained to think critically.

I guess that's why they don't feel the need to hammer down government-accepted propaganda. Keep our rose-tinted glasses on, no need to see the world as it is. And if we ever were to break from programming, no one will listen to us.

We're the dumb, uneducated folk who know no better. Any way we show opinions not held by the government, we are considered wrong and mentally insane. No one will accept us to work, and we may as well fucking die.

I guess one way to put it is that we see through their manipulations more easily than the regular folk in the normal classes. But it's not because we are smarter or wiser or whatever good thing you're thinking about. It's because they view us as not worth indoctrinating because we will be too fucking stupid to disobey, or people will clock us as fucking insane.

At least if you are in the normal class, you are more of a threat to their ideology because they can think for themselves. Thus, the indoctrination is necessary.

[...]

It took me a lot to fully grapple with all this. Hell, even as old as I am right now, I don't fully understand the extent of all this.

I was a hardworking, stellar student who lost it all and had to sacrifice learning for the sake of survival. At least then I was free. But then the scholarship program happened, and I, an impressionable kid who needed an out from poverty, took it up. And what do I get from it? False education, more bureaucracy and politicking, and more bullshit.

Also can I just say that school rules are fucking nuts? Uniform must be worn neatly at all times, including blazer, vest, blouse, bottoms, socks, and shoes. Hair must be tied back in some way, and no hair must be out of place. Girls aren't expected to have hair shorter than their chin. boys can't have hair longer than their eyebrows. No piercings, no tattoos, no jewelry, no makeup, no glasses. We have to wear contacts. Fucking, contacts.

The school classifies students based on their performance. Higher performing students are placed in better classes, with more teacher attention, resources, opportunities, and comfier classrooms. Lower performing students kinda get the opposite.

Classification changes at every term, so usually classes change slightly. Most of the changes happen in the lower classes. Higher-ranking classes tend to stay unchanged due to how the top-performing students stay very consistent.

There are some cases where a student from a low-ranked class jumps to one of the high-ranked classes. Although most of the time it's from students cheating their way. All of the cases are deemed that way. And they usually aren't seen ever again. Probably expelled for cheating.

According to the rumor mill, Jacqueline, one of the students of 1E who got bumped to 1B, was wrongfully expelled. Most said that she pulled all-nighters and spent a lot of her resources on achieving a decent average. Most did say that she gamed the system by taking advantage of the syllabus, sacrificing some tests to focus on others that weigh more in general. Either way, it may be honest work, and she might've deserved the rank increase. But she was expelled at the end of the day. Best guess is that the school board doesn't like it and decided she must've cheated.

By rule, at least in the previous status quo, we "special scholars" are either conceived to be the "top performing students" or "a class of their own". Some are skeptical of the thing, but like I said, most people bought into it.

Our placement at the end of high school is then compared to other students in other schools and reclassified to new class ranks. These class ranks determine our placement in higher education as well as job boards.
