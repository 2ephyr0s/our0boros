## Jean Paul Sartre: Existentialism

[https://iep.utm.edu/sartre-ex/](<https://iep.utm.edu/sartre-ex/>)

> *Sartre’s ontology is explained in his philosophical masterpiece, Being and Nothingness, where he defines two types of reality which lie beyond our conscious experience: the being of the object of consciousness and that of consciousness itself. The object of consciousness exists as “in-itself,” that is, in an independent and non-relational way. However, consciousness is always consciousness “of something,” so it is defined in relation to something else, and it is not possible to grasp it within a conscious experience: it exists as “for-itself.” An essential feature of consciousness is its negative power, by which we can experience “nothingness.” This power is also at work within the self, where it creates an intrinsic lack of self-identity. So the unity of the self is understood as a task for the for-itself rather than as a given.*



## Gilles Deleuze: *Anti-Oedipus*

[https://iep.utm.edu/gilles-deleuze/](<https://iep.utm.edu/gilles-deleuze/>)

> Deleuze is a key figure in postmodern French philosophy. Considering himself an empiricist and a vitalist, his body of work, which rests upon concepts such as **multiplicity, constructivism, difference, and desire**, stands at a substantial remove from the main traditions of 20th century Continental thought...Notably, within his metaphysics he favored a **Spinozian concept of a plane of immanence with everything a mode of one substance**, and thus on the **same level of existence**. He argued, then, that there is no good and evil, but rather only relationships which are beneficial or harmful to the particular individuals.

## Simone de Beauvoir: *The Ethics of Ambiguity*

[https://iep.utm.edu/simone-de-beauvoir/](<https://iep.utm.edu/simone-de-beauvoir/>)

> *In The ****Ethics of Ambiguity****, she developed an existentialist ethics that condemned the “spirit of seriousness” in which people too readily identify with certain abstractions at the expense of individual freedom and responsibility.*

## Lacan's mirror stage

[https://iep.utm.edu/lacweb/#SH2a](<https://iep.utm.edu/lacweb/#SH2a>)

> *Lacan’s article “The Mirror Stage as Formative of the I” (1936, 1949) lays out the parameters of a doctrine that he never foreswore, and which has subsequently become something of a post-structuralist mantra: namely, that human identity is “decentred.” The key observation of Lacan’s essay concerns the behaviour of infants between the ages of 6 and 18 months. At this age, Lacan notes, children become capable of recognizing their mirror image. This is not a dispassionate experience, either. It is a recognition that brings the child great pleasure. For Lacan, we can only explain this “jubilation” as a testimony to how, in the recognition of its mirror-image, the child is having its first anticipation of itself as a unified and separate individual. Before this time, Lacan contends (drawing on contemporary psychoanalytic observation), the child is little more than a “body in bits and pieces,” unable to clearly separate I and Other, and wholly dependant for its survival (for a length of time unique in the animal kingdom) upon its first nurturers.*
