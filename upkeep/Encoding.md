No one knows when it started nor when it ends. It's not like anybody documented their lives from start to end. What we can focus on however are the entities who happened to have impact on the physical world where history is actively recorded.

## Iterations

### Encoding system

Each code is mostly how I (the author) keep track on the iterations, with numbers being quite arbitrary (other than to establish order).

**General rules**

- Codes typically are composed of at least 4 numbers (+ letters and other stuff).
- Codes that are purely numbers indicate an 'original AU' (a.k.a. worlds that aren't referencing other media)
- Worlds that reference other media have at least one Latin/Roman alphabet mixed in (still at least 4 characters long)
- codes must be unique. it will be easier to just take direct abbreviations of the media + alphanumeric character to differentiate it OR add in a parenthesis depending on use case.
- Different/alternate versions of the same world have a parenthesis containing a sub-code at the end

**Examples**

- Origins: **0000** \--> 'Original AU'
- World inspired by *BNHA/MHA*:
- ***BNHA*** \--> Events take place simultaneously with events in canon
    - **WLGYM** \--> Sample AU that is inspired by *BNHA/MHA* (completely random letters)
- AU of Origins version 1: **0000(001**) --> `Origins` if it went slightly differently
- AU of 0777 inspired by `AAI`: **0777(*AAI*)** \--> `0777` if it went slightly differently; fusion with `AAI` (whichever AU it stands for)
- AU of 0132 inspired by 0404: **0132(0SDS)** \--> `SDS` is the abbreviated title I gave to 0404. I added a 0 at the start to make it 4 characters long + so I know it's an original AU.

> Rules are very much subject to change

### Origins

These 2 iterations form the basis of what usually happens in their realm.
- 0000 - ◇○■■ (lone being, origin)
- 0001 - □□□, °°° (when the lone being splits to 2 for the first time)

### Hands-on interaction

These are times where the entities play an active role on some section of the physical plane. This involves direct interaction with mankind, usually.
- 0122 - Groundhog day scenario but each time an element is moved slightly to the left and \*\*\*\* is the only one aware; more on that in the future
- 0132 - a slight deviation from 0122 where instead of the entity being aware, a random salary man is the victim. (more on that in the future)
- 0286 - Mae's TL and her infatuation towards a certain human. Is it romantic or pure obsession? I do not know.
- 0777 - Cass and Vi's TL
- 0798 - Meritocratic Fallacy where the entity is manipulating the circumstance slightly, leaving traces of cosmic nonsense in The Game as well as the 3rd party
- 0888 - Gambling AU with a slight twist; more on that in the future

### Slight impact

In these iterations, entities tend to mess around in the background but never make direct contact nor interact with the physical plane.
- 0100 - something based on apophenia; still figuring out details. Entity facilitates the distortion of the physical world.
- 0404 - when the personifications of the seven deadly sins decide to fuck up the world just so one day "the world" can stop keeping them alive. you can probably guess how the entity is involved in this one.
