**CODE:** TICD

**FULL:** The Iterations of Creation and Destruction

The umbrella AU for all iterations of the Entity of Creation (EC) and Entity of Destruction (ED).

By nature, these two entities are soul-like/energy-like/magic-like personifications (in our terms) that are omnipresent. They are meant to exist anywhere and everywhere, no matter which world (real or not). They essentially span the multiverse and are only at most one of each; they can go from one world to another but in most cases they reside to the *N*\-th dimension of one.

The multiverse is way too big and while they are "big enough" to span the whole, their selves are only a small section of infinity.

## KEY AUS

> It's going to eventually cover a lot of my AUs. the level of interaction done by the entity/entities will vary from marginal to absolutely centric

### 0777: BECOMING HUMAN

> **CODE:** 0777-BH
> 
> **FULL:** *Becoming Human*
> 
> **KEY IDEA:**
> 
> - *What makes a human?*
> 
> - Tackles if humanity is what people make of it. Is it the biological nature of humans that makes us human or the tendency for morality or humane living?
> 
> - The failures and *human-ess *of humans. The faculty of emotions; are these propensities emotions that make us human? Why should we have them when it impedes us?
> 
> - Why is it that humans look to "elder beings" for reason if they are the species with the advanced mind?

[0777-BH](<./../Becoming Human/0777-BH.md>)



### 0000: ABSOLUTE BEGINNING

> **CODE:** 0000-AB
> 
> **FULL:** *ABSOLUTE BEGINNING*
> 
> **KEY IDEA:**
> 
> - Study what is the Nth dimension
> 
> - Introduction to the entities
> 
> - Solidify origins: their natural demeanor, shapes of beings, concept of life, effects of fusion



### 0404: SEVEN DEADLY SINS

> **CODE:** 0404-SDS
> 
> **FULL:** *Seven deadly sins.*
> 
> **KEY IDEA:**
> 
> - 3 worlds, 7 sins, infinite whatifs.
> 
> - The mimicry of the entity, nameless and omnipresent
> 
> - Explores duality of man, embodiment of sins, pointlessness, and the tendency for men to look for guidance on... most things
> 
> - Entity acts as overseer that you don't see in narrative
> 
>     - ...it's just... probably that one suspicious person who is always there in the scene, enforcing beliefs, etc.
> 
>     - most definitely another malicious entity with clear disdain for anything residing in the 3rd dimension



### 0100: EXPLORING METAPHORS

> **CODE:** 0100-EM
> 
> **FULL:** *Exploring metaphors (APOPHENIA)*
> 
> **KEY IDEA:**
> 
> - Societal constructs and how they tell a story. And how we can distort it so far from its original meaning yet people can still think it one the same
> 
> - Detached from the happenings of the outer dimension
> 
> - Slight exploration of coincidental and unknown phenomena and the penchant for people to classify things even if they know little to anything mind likes to find plausible explanations for a lot of things
> 
> - Take any metaphor or story, twist it to the point of distortion, expand it and stretch it. see how much the human can reason out and connect symbolism that may not be present



### 0888: ADDICTED TO ACTS OF DEGENERACY

> **CODE**: 0888-AAD
> 
> **FULL**: *Addicted to Acts of Degeneracy (DOWNWARD SPIRAL)*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - How far would the worst of humans go in order to win?
> 
> - connected solely via landscape and multi-dimensional warping. The location is half managed by the being(s)
> 
>     - the being of this is a bit more on the morbid side. more thrill-seeking.
> 
>     - *in fact, what will be funny is if the beings themselves act as the head of the house of sorts, directly enabling the players.*
> 
> - Absolute degeneracy and various acts of debauchery, gambling, human trafficking, sexual abuse, perversion of morality, conditioning
> 
>     - this is... fairly dark.
> 
> - When curiosity and opportunity lend themselves, some people would choose to take it. Into a seedy casino you go, where in fact, you are not actually gambling away your savings! It's the idea of gambling made into a competition after all! We're seeing who is the best at winning, the luckiest bastard, and who will rise to the stakes and dominate the competition!

### 0122: ENTROPY

> **CODE**: 0122-E
> 
> **FULL**: *Entropy*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - a little look into the multiverse and what ifs
> 
>     - *it's more so a time-loop-esque story, but the world just strays slightly to the left each time*
> 
> - Let's just say that the world itself is high in entropy (bastardization of the definition aside)
> 
>     - scenarios happen seemingly at random, some due to our actions and some far beyond our own circumstances
> 
>     - hell, even the state of the world came to be due to a what could be describe as a *seed*
> 
>         - things happen how they did, and we are "programmed" to act a certain way due to previous data and calculated outcomes
> 
>     - but even *seeds must be selected at random, and we just happen to get a good seed. who chooses that seed?*
> 
> - ANYWAY, this one will be a scenario where instead of sticking to one seed, each day a new seed is pulled and outcomes of the previous world change to fit the data of the new seed
> 
>     - say if in seed 1, A --> B --> C, seed 2 can have A --> D --> C or E --> F-- C or X --> Y --> Z
> 
> - And all throughout, only one stays constant, the FUCKING ENTITY since they are detached from the mechanisms of the world
> 
>     - it will be funny if it's a pair, and one is a self-insert (in a sense they are the aware character) and another is a watcher (slash observer).



### 0132: EXERCISE IN FUTILITY

> **CODE**: 0132-EIF
> 
> **FULL**: *Exercise in Futility*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - if a person attempts to do the same thing they know will achieve no results, some may say they are mad
> 
> - however, if a person tries to do something novel, bordering on absurd, they are also mad in the eyes of the people
> 
> - truly, there are many social definitions of the word, but all of them mean nothing good
> 
> - see, say we put someone mad into a world beyond their control, where the groundhog day occurs
> 
>     - there's no reason for it. no grand mission, no godly purpose
> 
>     - for all we know, this madman is your **average worker who sticks to routine and banality like it's their lifeline**
> 
> - *slight exploration of what constitutes madness, and the various forms it fits into*
> 
>     - few options to end it all: Kill God (the entity) (NOT POSSIBLE), Kill thyself, succumb to it, and go about your day.
> 
> - a little more hands-on approach from the entity. they have no say in this, to be fair, they are not omnipotent.
> 
>     - they do have some connection to omnipotent entities. their current iteration of Chronos truly has several screws loose



### 0286: STAGNATE

> **CODE**: 0286-S
> 
> **FULL**: *Stagnate*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - "Star-crossed lovers"
> 
> - This particular being is rather... easily attached. She grow to enjoy the company of one individual within infinite dimensions
> 
>     - She happens to... possess, and impersonate dead individuals and seek out this individual no matter the universe
> 
>     - Benefits come with her being technically immortal and able to travel the multiverse
> 
> - Rather possessive, rather obsessive, rather codependent.
> 
> - How did this iteration end? Simple. Heartbreak from an action taken too far.
> 
>     - When slowly she stops seeing him as a person
> 
>     - When slowly she compares him with his previous versions
> 
>     - When slowly she starts changing him to fit her vision
> 
>     - When slowly... he had enough.
> 
> - It was quite short lived, this iteration. Things progress seemingly quickly.

### 0798: MERITOCRATIC FALLACY

> **CODE**: 0798-MF
> 
> **FULL**: *Meritocratic Fallacy*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - A survival game with a known system devolves into chaos
> 
> - a system that tests your ability to think on your feet. a game that forces you to plan, adapt and cooperate. when ground rules are established and the playing ground is fair, then it must be **those who are most skilled who truly excel.**
> 
> - however one must account for luck and coincidence. one must recall a skilled human is just as human and fallible to the biases and emotional pitfalls. skill doesn't automatically translate to success.
> 
> - but then we change the stakes and remove all grounds for fairness. we change the game such that it is now the player against the system. the rules change and what we require shifts. *the one who gains the favor of the mastermind shall reach the top; ****luck is the ultimate deciding factor***.
> 
> - Set in a meritocratic society where rankings are published and everything about you is tracked and taken into account.

### 0048: [2]EPHYR[0]S

> **CODE**: 0048-2PH
> 
> **FULL**: *[2]EPHYR[0]S*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - an exploration on multifaceted truths and conditional laws.
> 
> - this specific iteration outlines outright the nature of an entity and the happenings of the nth-plane
> 
> - an entity that projects a three-dimensional puppet as a way of interacting with the third dimension. it mimics wrongly, it has no motives, it bears no identity. it is but a puppet, a child playing make believe in all the wrong ways. it does not care.
> 
> - it is an entity with agency. it is an entity that falls victim to the whims of the world around it.
> 
> - the objective truth that we come to believe are fragments of a larger whole. we run with the assumptions that the laws are universally held; we never come to wonder if there exist those unbound by these laws.
> 
> - it also considers the multidimensional nature of the entity. depicted in a two dimensional screen, we, as the viewer can only see so much. and when the entity moves erratically, these images will flicker and shift.
> 
> - the true nature of the entity is chaos. we cannot perceive it in true form. so it adapts. or perhaps, we as the viewer *adapt*.
> 
> - a partial exploration on biases and extrapolation

<div data-block-id="qpadBuvS" data-callout-type="abstract" class="collapsed callout"><h4 data-block-id="Yr8X1hJW">SIDE RAMBLE</h4><p data-block-id="_xAXk3MJ" data-spacing="double">Sorry it's an obsession at this point it's wacky cosmic horror honestly. The entity is modified quite regularly by its environment, and sometimes it destabilizes and disintegrates before being reconstructed by the 'world' as a way for it to correct its course. It has agency but it is still a byproduct of its environment.</p><p data-block-id="6bztvynU" data-spacing="double">Also, the concept of forbidden knowledge and the punishment being a 'rewrite'.</p><p data-block-id="UUJXxpDS" data-spacing="double">the slight melodrama comes in the fact that it is not human and can never belong to human society despite appearing human. it is too different. too nonsensical. too faulty by human standards. it operates on a different ruleset it inherently knows that humans can never fully understand.</p></div>



### 0??4: And the Death Bells Toll - The Bad TL

> **CODE**: 0048-???
> 
> **FULL**: *And the Death Bells Toll*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - Timeline 1 of two options
> 
> - A reincarnation plot; an entity has reincarnated to become a different being.
> 
> - Unlike expected, it remembers the deeds it does when acting as a non-entity.
> 
>     - in both iterations, the entity is reincarnated onto the same position and world.
> 
>     - in essence, it is the same timeline, but the possibilities branch depending on the effects of two different sets of entities.
> 
> - This entity after reincarnating tries to right its wrongs, but the world gave him no reprieve.
> 
> - He has obtained his role once more. He has the chance to right all wrongs. The world heeds not his wishes. So he crashes harder than he did the first time around.



### 0??3: And the Death Bells Toll - The Good TL

> **CODE**: 0048-???
> 
> **FULL**: *And the Death Bells Toll*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - Timeline 2 of two options
> 
> - A reincarnation plot; an entity has reincarnated to become a different being.
> 
> - This entity after reincarnating tries to right its wrongs, and the world rewards him in turn.



### 0??2: And the Death Bells Toll - ORIGINS

> **CODE**: 0048-???
> 
> **FULL**: *And the Death Bells Toll*
> 
> **KEY IDEA**:
> 
> - The Entity's iteration.
> 
> - Peak of moral bankruptcy
