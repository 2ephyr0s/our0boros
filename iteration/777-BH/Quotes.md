## Cassian

- "Vitus... what are we? Really. What is... us?"

- "Mr. Freire, is it? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Say, how about you sit for a bit while I fetch you some tea?"

- "How interesting... these.. pipes? So fragile yet is what ensures survivability of the human body. Humans call them blood vessels... wonder if I can reinforce them somehow. They burst too easily."

- "If I were to... sever this part? You do know that humans that have these parts damaged cannot function properly. Why should I do that then?"

- "Hello, I am Wilson Adams. I am a forensic scientist, though I do dabble in research with 99Labs whenever I am available. I am quite keen in neurobiology myself..."

## Isabella

- "Why are you playing along with her? Didn't you just tell me that she hates your guts?"

- "Hey! There's this new book that I want to check out that may be interesting to you. Want to come with? We'll get snacks after!"

- "Elijah... thanks."

- "Do you think mum is having fun up there?"

- "...the city is set aflame... but I can only think how comforting it is to simply sit and let it warm you in the cold night..."

- "...I guess there's no room for pretty dreams here, is there?"

## Andrea

- "Dude, isn't it unfair to gang up on a pretty lad like her? Especially when she's defenseless like that? Honestly, men these days."

- "Shut the fuck up. Questions later. First, we run. I know a spot."

- "Look at this place! What makes you think the government gives a shit about us?"

- "Bella, is it? Nice to meet you. I'm Andrea Miller. Hope we get along just fine."

- "The inadequacy of the enforcers of the system only exacerbates the long-standing problem that plagues the inhabitants of the system..."

## Elijah

- "Hmm. Money first, then we'll talk."

- "No Isabella I cannot take you shopping I need to meet with a client tonight. Oh c'mon you know I cannot postpone the meeting... fine."

- "Are you *really *ready to know this. It's not to late to go home and forget all this. Saves you from being targeted at least."

- "...I know someone who can help you. Though before that, turn of your phones and wear this. Follow me."

## GAIA

- "WHERE IS LUCIAN!? WHERE IS MY BROTHER!?"

- "How much do you value your truth?"

- "I believe that your choices makes you. And whatever decision you make, I will forever stand behind you so long you hold no regrets on your choices."

- "Signs of hemorrhaging... if this goes on he'll become anemic. The local hospitals will require his chip to treat him... the alternative is Dr. Reid, and she... Oh fuck it Reid's better than no one."

- "No, kid. You cannot divide both sides by 0. Why? Logically, you know dividing something to 0 items seem incomprehensible. Though in the math world, if you consider limits of the numerator and denominator... oh yea I shouldn't expect you to get that. Sorry, carry on."
