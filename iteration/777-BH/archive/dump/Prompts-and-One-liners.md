**How would your character react to a little kid trying to find their parents?**

(@owl.\_.heart on Instagram)

- **Andrea: **"Alright, kid, hold my hand, let's go ask around."

- **Cassian: **"Ah, how unfortunate. Could you tell me where you last saw them?"

- **Elijah: **"...Did your parents tell you where they went?" or "C'mon, let's look around."

- **Gaia: **"There, there, we'll find them in no time! Now where could they be..."

- **Isabella: **"Aww... please don't cry. Hey, how about this? We walk around and play I spy for a bit?"

- **Vitus: **"Oh? baby lost their parents, hm? I think I saw someone shouting over there..." or they just ignore the kid.

**"What happened to the child you were?"**

(@owl.\_.heart on Instagram)

- **Andrea: **"She grew up. There's nothing else to it."

- **Cassian: **"He changed as time flows by, each moment building on the other, creating the right kind of person."

- **Elijah: **"Don't you have better questions to ask?"

- **Gaia: **"Her eyes opened as she realised she needed to burn. So she did, and the world became brighter for it."

- **Isabella: **"...I don't know. She's still there, isn't she? I don't think she ever left."

- **Vitus: **"What makes you think the child existed? What makes you think the child was ever a child?"

**What will your character do if they're met face to face with their plot with no warning?**

(@urfriendlywriter on Tumblr)

*I am assuming the plot is personified in this*

- **Andrea: **One mean right hook coming straight up.

- **Cassian: **"Oh." and he just stares for a bit before moving on.

    - He does not care for the whims of the plot, and frankly, asking for any information would make this game less interesting.

- **Elijah: **"Fucking hell, are you kidding? Well, damn it all, I guess. Tell me, how will the next 3 months go?"

- **Gaia: **"...Is this *actually* appropriate? Won't this break the supposed space-time continuum? Acting on forbidden knowledge and all that?"

- **Isabella: **"Cool! Now, why on earth are you here? And please tell me if our plans will succeed in about 3 months."

- **Vitus: **"Bloody hell, this is something alright. If I were to shoot you in the face right now, do you think the world will still stand?"

**What will your character do if they discovered a dead body?**

(@urfriendlywriter on Tumblr)

- **Andrea: **"Lord give me strength," as she runs towards the CRUCIBLE to get the manager (who happens to be a retired mob boss).

- **Cassian: **"Hmm? How convenient... body is still in state of livor mortis, given the bruises and the lacking stiffness... scarring found on non-lethal areas and no displaced organs," and he takes it with him.

- **Elijah: **He's silent as he takes in the features known to him, mourns the loss of a life, then calls upon an associate who could identify the body.

- **Gaia: **She stills in absolute shock, staring at the body as if waiting for it to move. And she runs. No matter how often she sees them, she'll never get used to it.

- **Isabella: **"No, this is not real. This is not real. This is not real. This is-"

- **Vitus: **He swoops in and takes it with him. A backup body will always be useful.

**"It's fine, you can cry. I won't snitch."**

(@asmoshywrites on Tumblr)

- **Andrea: **She'll be reluctant to cry; years of hurt accumulating to barely bursting rage. Her first instinct is to punch the wall beside her. The next is to scream. It is then she finally shed her tears (and silent is her sorrow)

- **Cassian: **"Ah... you. Alright." He remains silent as he sits next to you, looking ahead at the setting sun. He then slouches and lets a few tears fall. Whatever he did to have you assume he's sad, he doesn't know. Still, he feigns his sadness anyway.

- **Elijah: **He bristles, hands trembling harder than usual—his gaunt more obvious than ever. Still, the tears never fell as he dissipated into the dark.

- **Gaia: **"I trust that you won't, but I am in no position to burden you with this." Her head still held high, stance as formidable as ever. She's the symbol of decaying hope--she cannot falter for a single moment. And so she leaves, maintaining the image of strength, before falling apart in the darkness of her room.

- **Isabella: **Her body shakes, and her hands are clenched. Tears were streaming down her face before she could stop them. That's when she faces you, eyes steely and unflinching. She brings you close and hugs you tight as she continues to weep.

- **Vitus: **"Hm. How sweet," and ultimately boring. The conversation has run its course, sympathy earned easily. Seeing nothing else could come forth from it, he leaves.

**What will your character do if they're being threatened?**

(@urfriendlywriter on Tumblr)

- **Andrea: **She'll assess briefly on what she's done to warrant the threat and react accordingly. She'll either accept the threat and take steps to prevent it from occurring or rebut the other, calling the threat unwarranted or baseless. Surprisingly argumentative, she is. Either way, she will take all threats seriously. She'll fix her appearance, negotiate with strangers, or relocate entirely if need be. In the end, her survival comes first, and she'll do whatever she can to ensure she's safe.

- **Cassian: **His reaction wholly depends on the severity and scale of the threat. If he believes he can sidestep the entire ordeal or deal with it if it ever happens, he'll not care much about it. He'll brush up on any martial art skill he has, learn the ins and outs of any establishment he sets foot in, and be wary of any meetups until he is very sure the threat is of a manageable level. He's not in a hurry to eliminate the threat, for it brings something interesting to the table.

- **Elijah: **It's kind of a normal Tuesday for him, so he is pretty desensitized to all kinds of threats to his being. Bodily harm? Have a medic on speed dial. Personal assets and data? Spread around in various institutions, tied to a variety of identities and known to only him. Life or death? The bigwigs of the underground will not be happy if he bites the dust, and almost everyone knows that. Threaten the safety of Isabella, and you get a whole other thing entirely (He'll seize any advantage he can; pull out favours, enact contingencies, anything to eliminate the threat).

- **Gaia: **She braves through it, feigns nonchalance, and relaxes her body language. Her eyes break the illusion, however: her stare unflinching as she stares down the opposition. She may not make a big deal of the situation, she may dismiss the event, but she recognizes the threat to her safety, and therefore also the kids in her care. How she deals with the threat differs based on severity and the potential risk. She is much more likely to sacrifice herself if it means her kids will remain safe.

- **Isabella: **Likely, the threat will not register immediately. Give her about 2 or 3 minutes, and she'll panic as it sinks in. She'll then try to negotiate her way out, offering whatever she has on hand or whatever it is she can offer right now, so long as the perceived threat will not last beyond the end of the day.

- **Vitus: **"How cute," they said. Vitus will not take any threats seriously for the most part; after all, they are pretty much untouchable. Depending on the context, they might view it as either a win (the desired outcome) or a disappointment (too predictable). They'll also probably rate the received threat based on delivery, fear factor, and overall danger.

**What kind of music does your character like?**

(@urfriendlywriter on Tumblr)

- **Andrea: **She doesn't listen to a ton of music, but she wouldn't mind a good piece of dubstep music to keep her going. She's big on rhythm and heavy beats, something that builds momentum. Lyricality and tune are not so much a priority either.

- **Cassian: **He doesn't see the point of music, nor does he feel the need to be well-versed in the classics. He doesn't have a favorite kind, but will answer with Baroque.

- **Elijah: **He generally listens to Lo-fi to ignore the mayhem that surrounds him (if the situation allows). Otherwise, he doesn't spend much time listening to music. His job does require attentiveness and vigilance after all.

- **Gaia: **Most definitely EDM or adjacent to it. She's likely to recognise renowned artists and talk about them in depth. She does have a soft spot for select noise music and a good variety of rock, dubstep, and chiptune.

- **Isabella: **She's unsurprisingly a big fan of indie and experimental music. While her fixations don't lie on the music scene, music is occasionally discussed in relation to fictional characters in fandom as she knows a few big-name indie musicians. She also adores music that's big on instrumentals and sounds 'grandiose'.

    - a/n: for context, i have *satella's Thopia *album* *in mind for her.

- **Vitus: **They understand the importance of music in the social setting, or at least observe recurring patterns in the clubs or bars they visit. In fact, those are the only times they interact with music, so their taste most likely leans towards EDM or dance music. They know enough to strike up a light conversation, but nothing much outside of it.

**"Who's going to save you when everyone is gone?"**

(@akmwrites on Tumblr remixed to fit this format)

- **Andrea: **"No one, clearly. Everyone's gone after all. Isn't that obvious?"

- **Cassian: **"If everyone is gone, then it must be that I am also gone, for I am part of 'everyone', am I not?"

- **Elijah: **"Is this an attempt at a threat? If so, that's a *really* bad one."

- **Gaia: **"I'll save myself if I need to, but know this. Whoever 'everyone' is meant to be, I would do whatever it takes to ensure 'everyone' is *not *gone." However idealistic she portrays herself to be, she knows this is a herculean task. In fact, it is very much impossible. But one can dare to dream.

- **Isabella: **"...I truly hope it doesn't come to that, but if it ever does? Then I'll endeavour to be the hero of my own story."

- **Vitus: **"Then I wouldn't need saving. If you're the threat, then you'll be gone as part of 'everyone else'. If something else is, then I might as well bite the dust. Can't escape inevitability after all." (Oh, they absolutely could, for they're not bound to this reality. No one needs to know that, though. Where's the fun in that?)

**When do they feel the most alive?**

(@luna-azzurra on Tumblr)

- **Andrea: **When is she not? Her heart beats loudly in her ear at every moment. The cold air from the AC brushes her skin. The sounds of chatter ever present every step she makes in the gilded halls. She is aware, too aware of her existence, as small as it is. She lives and breathes and tries to survive society's game, rushing to not be left behind. And for that, she lives. (She cherishes the small moments of mercy. The soft hum of a broken heater and the scent of books much older than she is. In moments of clarity is when she finally gets to exhale.)

- **Cassian: **He'll give you a different answer each time, from the big moments under the stage light to small moments of solace by the nightstand. But do any ever ring fully true? He'll say it is. The crinkle in his eyes reveals a gentle nature, while the distant stare suggests an attempt at introspection. Who is not taken away by this show of vulnerability? (All the small acts belie a truly calculative man. Close associates who knew him will jest and dismiss his very word. But none will truly know the absolute truth, for what human is never alive in the first place?)

- **Elijah: **Under the dim lights of the city's darkest corners, he runs and evades. He talks, he negotiates, he offers his work, all the while adrenaline buzzes his very being. The wind brushes his worn-out jacket, his mask entrapping his breath as he makes his rounds. The hum of the cityscape is loud in his ears, the show of bustling life that mirrors the running thoughts that hound his mind at every second. And then is when he truly lives.

- **Gaia: **The spotlight shines down on her, guitar in hand, and the audience roaring. Bandmates surround her, banging out note after note. She follows suit with her own tune, one riff after another. Her ears listen for cues as she counts the beat in her head. Her left palm quickly runs through the frets as she feels and embodies the song. The lights dance as the music swells, illuminating the energy that fills the room. Her heart thumps at every 4th beat as she soars high.

- **Isabella: **Under the covers is where she truly gets to be. Tucked under the sheets and staring past the clouds to see the starless sky, she laments. She thinks about her parents, she worries about her friends, and she loses herself in the wrongs of her actions. But then she dreams. She dreams of islands far away and creatures she has yet to meet. She envisions the starry sea and shooting stars and glowing fireflies that dance to the beat of their own. She brings close the pillow of her own creation, soft to the touch and stained with tears from years prior. And there, she breathes.

- **Vitus: **"When I am with you, gorgeous," they flirted. Or perhaps, "when the alcohol truly hits." But then again, "when I get to see someone smile," is also a valid answer. Or, "the moments where I stand under the streetlight as I stare at the abyss despite the rain." There are too many answers, each a different variation of mundanity tailored to fit the theme of the conversation. The role they play necessitates a different answer to the previous, but it doesn't mean they are all lies. The little moments they reference are all part of what makes a human alive, after all. (But what about a human that was never alive? Then there's no point in answering the question, now is there?)
