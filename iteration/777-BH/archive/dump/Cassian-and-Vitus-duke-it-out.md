Cassian: Vitus, let's stop this sham fight. Please.

Vitus: Oh come on, Cassie dear. Just imagine what could happen if we just fused together! Doesn't the promise of becoming almighty become fairly alluring? Doesn't it sound fascinating to see what happens beyond all this? What may happen once we ascend?

Cassian: And risk our death? Becoming nothing? Dying out? The risks are endless! Aren't you the one who preaches about living life? Isn't dying counterproductive?

Vitus: But what's life without taking risks! Really, Cassie, don't you see how boring this life will eventually become? Living the droll lives as ourselves? And maybe dying is part of living! Starting anew as a more powerful being living a new life? Isn't that a dream!

Cassian: ...do you not fear loss? loss of the little things? our times together, the memories shared, the impact we left? All are fickle and once we fused we could be gone! We assumed we can coexist in a shared body together but it is only a theory! there are so many things that can go wrong and we may simply disappear without any trace! We are the only ones to know our actions! We are the only ones who know our impact! does it mean nothing to you?

Vitus: ...brother dear, aren't you a hypocrite?

Cassian: And you are a greedy fool.
