1. they tried to recreate the human body

2. they possessed a random corpse

3. they possessed a corpse that just died and feed it with bullshit energy

4. they are still bleeding everywhere but can move

5. they have the memories of the corpse but very muted and they don't understand what they are. thus ignored.

6. they learn to crawl then walk

7. they find an abandoned location

8. they try to make sense of 3d space

9. they pick part their decaying body

10. they try to fix the body

11. kidnapped and studied; ran away after several times and refuse to follow along

12. they try to *surgically *fix the body (mimicking the researchers. albeit wrongly but hey it gets the job done)

13. they fuck up the body further but are not aware that they did

14. they traumatise people

15. they go back and try to surgically fix themselves further

16. they can function but are not literate and cannot speak. they mime at best bur again, a bit unnatural and limited.

17. they saw children at school

18. they saw children being taught by older people

19. they understood that children are treated differently when they act out

20. they possess recently decesed children and surgically fix the body

21. unknowingly they have the child's very malleable brain

22. they managed to sneak into a class and learn things.

23. since child cannot grow, they eventually abandoned the body in favor of other bodies appropriate for their age

24. sometimes they keep possessing young children because that is what they can find and thus obtained weird prodigy status. they end up 'missing' after a few years.

25. they learnt the language and basic stuff over the years (very quickly)

26. they move on to study biochemistry and neuroscience. they faked their documents

27. vitus dropped out. cassian continued.

28. vitus used whatever skills they have to do whatever he does.

29. cassian further hones into his physical identity and makes it as a forensic scientist.

30. and that leads us to whatever the plot goes



## Motivations

### Cassian 

He just wants to study the body in its biological form and seeing the absolute limits of what the body can take.

Doing so requires him to connect with others who are much more capable and have resources he cannot obtain. Thus he plays nice and learns the rules and arbitrary human classifcations.

Social norms is a means to an end; social acclimation is a game for him to work out. What he should flaunt, what he should suppress, what he should change, all that impacts the kind of access he obtains. And so he figures out what is the best possible combination to obtain the ideal outcome.

He switches between identities less often than Vitus. Quadruple lives are easy to manage when you need no rest and bodies can be kept flourishing. If one identity fails to obtain the outcome needed, he uses it for a different purpose and switches to another identity.

### Vitus

He doesn't see himself learning human anatomy nor biology to the extent of Cassian. It baffles him a bit on how they lean towards different aspects of humanity, but he chalks it to simply being just as curious in a different field of study. Maybe they were created that way. Maybe the brains they inhabit have certain inclinations. Maybe it's due to the impermanent nature of his being that he sees messing with other humans as something much more entertaining. Any could be the answer and he cares not to figure it out.

Vitus jumps from one body to another. He plays different roles in society, from your average salary man to a mafia don. Countless names, countless genders, and a lot of different choices. He thrives in the randomness of social interaction. And without the fears of failing a conversation, he can act however dramatic he chooses to be.

Soon he is able to detect patterns to himan response to certain actions he does. At some point, he tailors his actions to obtain a specific reaction that benefits him in the future (such as gaining a favor or social status). Does he have a plan on what to do with these benefits? Not so much. Perhaps entertainment, perhaps for Cassian's sake, perhaps for a bigger plan of *being the ultimate kingpin*.

He will figure it out.



## Expansion

**when do they start understanding rather than copying**

I'd say when they're possessing children or teens, even more so after learning the language and writing.

Neuroplasticity is at its highest once the brain is 'reactivated'. And because they can move from one child body to another, they obtain an extended critical period. While knowledge doesn't carry over as much, note taking aids their understanding and information transferral.

With the basic information obtained and understood, they are able to make connections and expand on what they know. It also helps that learning is easier for a child brain.

Eventually, they were able to transfer knowledge in the brain to a cloud system, thus enabling transferral of information from one brain to another. So if a body is a no-go, they can simply back up their 'brain' and sync it with a new one, thus no need for much relearning.



**do others name them?**

In terms of their identity, not really. It is much more likely for them to name themselves with whatever word they come up with or see (or pretend to be mute if they cannot offer anything).

Given the bodies they possess were humans with identities, it is possible that people who know who the bodies were to be appalled and bewildered, calling them by their original name. They were confused at first, not knowing what is up. They were at some point studied (how is a dead person alive) but before the researchers can make significant progress, the lab burnt (not by the entities' doing).

the situation occured multiple times until they decided it got too predictable and moved onto studying their own bodies (mimicking the researchers).



**how do they feel about possessing dead children?**

Nothing much; if it gets the job done then why not? These two have no inclination on pondering ethics.

Cassian does ask the question: "why not study on humans?" on one occasion and is met with reasons regarding ethical practices and rulesets. He knows that humans think studying science on other humans is a horrible act but he doesn't really *understand *the implications. So he plays along in legitimate lab settingsm Otherwise he will just do whatever gets the best results. Even go as far as studying children.

*(He knows the act is bad, and he may stumble on reasoning why so, but that does not imply that he understands what he knows and says. For he knows not the concept of pain or struggle nor feels injustice nor disparity)*

Vitus is perhaps more outwardly concerned for their breaches of ethics. What motivates him is mostly the reactions of others when faced with his line of thinking. He will parrot whichever view he posits gets the best reaction. He spouts arguments for either stance, logical or otherwise. He never cared for the ethics; whichever brings the most fun is what matters most.

*(He understands that humans view the act as morally abhorrent, so isn't it all the more interesting to see how they will react if he was to do the deed? Maybe he will play along if it benefits him. His stance? It really depends on what the moment, and once he settles, he brings it home.)*



**Do they dream?**

In a literal sense, perhaps so if they choose to sleep.

One of the perks of living off 'energy' is that they only need to keep up the bare minimum just so they body is nourished and appears well. They can go days without sleeping, and even if they sleep, they don't *really* sleep. Only their bodies are required to sleep and even then the benefits of sleep can be replicated to an extent by them.

Though sometimes the easiest thing to do is sleep, and so they do. Then the question is what is the true cause of dreams.

If we go by the theory that dreams are caused by random brain activity, then it is plausible that they dream in that sense.

But do they *dream*? Maybe in a sense that they look forward to what the future brings, what identities they can embody, but not so much ideas of grandeur.

Imagination and desire might be a product of neurones firing and neurotransmitters doing their job, so they come about once they have an active brain going. It doesn't really mean they understood fully what is going on until they're taught about it.
