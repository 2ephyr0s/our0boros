## Shadow? form

### General traits

- They aren't tangible in the literal sense. They can interact with each other's bodies, deform them or carry them, however.

- They shapeshift; they decide on a form they like and keep it that way. It's based on comfort and how they feel. Not much aesthetic preference given they can't see in their main form.

- No body systems. How they manage to have a mind (that seems human) is unknown. (their displays of emotion are sort of superficial and projected.)

### Interactions with the physical world

- they interpret energy lines (more on that later)

- people with a high 6th sense could see some blobs of concentrated energy (them) that are indescribable. people of a certain family can see them as they are, though.

## In human form

### Transformation

*This one is altered to fit more in context*  
In essence, the form shrinks down to something 3D. In layman's terms it can be considered shapeshifting. They also have to be able to maintain 3D physical form and function as human, thus having to adjust and create physical organs and a functioning body, skeleton and all.

If not feasible, there are other methods to get hold of a body. Modifications must be done in order to ensure functioning and degree of control, however.

### General traits

- Will have a mockery of a biological system containing important components in the wrong areas and different sizes. Will fail to live otherwise. (there was a lot of trial and error and so much body horror before they got it right.)

- Abides the laws of physics. I.e. they can't just dimension travel, fly, materialize objects from thin air, etc. So no powers, except for whatever the fuck is up with their body.

- Initially, they have a lot of limitations in diet, energy conserves, mobility and other stuff. Things get better once they learnt the human biology (they create better organs, basically).

- They learn more effectively as a product of having an actual brain. Oh. and emotions are real now.
