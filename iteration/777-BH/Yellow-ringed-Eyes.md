## INCIDENT REPORT

REPORT NUMBER **`DF-7253`**

Date: `28/03/2176 `

Location: `Bar Dimminuendo, 1935 Y-7, District Phi`

Issue: `Yellow-ringed eyes, Resurrection`

Summary:

*A man is found to have ****spontaneously deconstructed ****in Bar Diminuendo at District Phi, Y Avenue, 7th Street.*

*The man is identified to be the late Marlon Pierpoint, a former senior member of ****METIS CO.****. He died at age 79 on 05/02/2153 from poisoning. His body was never found after his death.*

*The body was found to be ****alive**** in the bar. When confronted, Pierpoint refused to give out his name or state of affairs. It is to be noted that the body is the same as it was when he first died. He did not age. However, his skin appears to be faded, and his movements are restricted. He was able to function well despite his age; thus, we can assume he still retains mental faculties.*

*Pierpoint was arrested for suspicions of colluding with the ****unnamed rebel force ****and was thus arrested. He evaded arrest by ****spontaneously deconstructing, ****leaving us with an unmoving body.*

*Upon further study of the body, we observe that Pierpoint has ****yellow-ringed eyes**** similar to several individuals prior. The body is sent to 99Labs for further study.*
