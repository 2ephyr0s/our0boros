## Astrology charts

- considered as falsehood (scientifically debunked)

- presumed propaganda

- relics and ephemeris disregarded and destroyed

- few artifacts were safely guarded by an amcestral family in India. no access is given to outsiders.

- faux systems have been made by academics trying to restore astrology, but planets have far been shifted and various events have happened that made the old system assumed to be obsolete.

- and without much frame of reference, they flounder.

## Tarot

- also scientifically debunked

- And perceived to be 'scammy' and 'scares people with the unknown'

- allusions to the cosmic being called fate. considered magical.

- underground tarot readers still exist performing the art

## Several languages and cultures

- I am pretty sure that dying languages will have died

- And if some countries rise to power and further damn economically weeker countries...

    - culture stamped out

    - languages stamped out

## (some) Social media

- Global tension! Censorship! Government control!

- Global social media like Instagram, X (Twitter) might no longer function by countries possibly opting to use their own social media platform

- Besides they can probably implement better systems based on their discoveries

## Journalism... in some sense

- 'Videos are less likely to be miscontrued by avoiding the subjectivity of language'

- Technically audio descriptions or braille descriptions are given, but it will be filtered to hell and back to ensure 'objectivity'

- Less published opinion pieces or essays to prevent spread of propaganda
