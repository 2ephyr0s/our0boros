**If iterations are entities not bound to space-time logic, then it may be possible that multiple iterations of entities may exist in one universe at a time. For example, an iteration occupies a world inhabited by entities of a different iteration.**

Good point, and there are few ways I might resolve this and it's kind of up in the air on which one I'll settle with.

1. Establish a general rule: Entities present in one universe must sum up to -1, 0 or 1, where an entity of creation is 1 and an entity of destruction is -1. A singular entity encompassing both will be considered 0. In the event an entity enters a dimension occupied with another entity and the balance shifts to beyond -1, 0 or 1, averse effects will spring upon the current universe rendering it unstable to all beings. This will only be resolved if the balance is restored. There is not so much punishment, just consequences.

2. The universe (or the world) course corrects. Each iteration that disrupts the balance will be sent to another universe entirely without question.

3. Ensure the iterations never think of entering an already-balanced universe due to sheer instinct. The thought never comes to mind and if it ever does, alarm bells ring.

4. Assume this could never happen, as the rule insists only up to two can exist within this universe, and the sum can only be 0 at every iteration. Other iterations may inject themselves into a timeline when effects of a previous iteration (or future iteration) have taken place, or a timeline exactly the same as the one inhabited by another iteration before shit happens (for example, iterations 998 and 999 take place in the same world but the timelines ultimately branch off to reach different outcomes due to the iteration). **(i will note that there is quite a hole in this logic left as an exercise to the reader)**

5. Two or more iterations can exist at a universe at a time only if they never meet OR they are not aware that the disruptor the balance is an entity (for example, entities from iterations 999 and 998 settle in one universe and the entities in 999 are not aware of the entity of 998 and vice versa)

**Inherent moral goodness is seemingly a rarity. Given that an entity's behaviour and to some extent identity can be random, why can't they just be inherently kind?**

I guess that's the thing. As of now (and it can change depending on whatever circumstance), I believe morality is a social construct created for us to improve as a society.

By definition, morality is the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. What I understood from these are that morality encompasses laws that differentiate what is right and wrong. Furthermore, being right in this case means morally good, justified or acceptable whereas wrong is the opposite. In this sense morality dictates what actions are considered acceptable or justified.

Then consider who decides what is right and what is wrong: either the individual or the group. A person has the right to judge their own actions. A person also has the right to form opinions on another's actions. These will form the basis of what the individual considers as right.

So we can say morality is up to the individual and leave it at that. However, consider that what you define as right or wrong may not be in agreement with each other and instead be counterproductive.

Consider two individuals living in isolation. Assume food source is finite (N) that can be split to two where individual 1 has n1 and individual 2 has n2. On one end, individual 1 may believe that they have the right to earn their keep and thus one shall not steal from the other. on the other hand, individual 2 may consider that for collective survival, they should share resources, allowing one to steal from the other shall there be a need. Given there is no framework to establish who is right, this society would have to come up with a suitable one that fits their situation.

Therefore, to remedy the chaos, we establish order by compromising the values we hold and what actions are permissible. Thus the creation of laws and morality. Thus the social construct bit.

(can you see i have yet to research metaethics?)

It being a social construct does not diminish the fact that it is something we ought to uphold especially for the betterment of the group.

Also note that I am not arguing tor what constutes morality or moral believes. And while my argument can be spun as morality being a list of rules (whcih after some thought is how I considered it), the way societies implement said sules will differ. Some may emphasise on a common understanding, such as simply do to others what you would do to yourself. Others may focus on the consequences to make our judgement on right amd wrong.

Now after establishing all this, I will get to the point.

Given that morality in this sense is created for society to prosper, it is meaningless in a world where a society does not exist. Furthermore, a judgement on what is right and wrong can only be made if the individual is capable of making that decision. Entities by nature are not capable of making this distinction.

In the event that they integrate themselves into the human body and possess capabilities of thought, then they are beholden (but not forced) to uphold the moral code of said society. In this case, some entities can choose to follow the code for whatever reason they create.

And lastly, I will address the point of human natural kindness. Now I'm not sure whether humans are inherently kind, but I do know that acts of kindness may be rewarding, and perhaps instinctual to some.

I am not opposed to the idea of that happening to the entities inhabiting the body. And yes, if they are particularly in tune with the emotions of the body (and that relies on a fully functioning brain) they might feel the serotonin that comes from a socially acceptable act.

However, what's commonly the case with these entities is the inherent disconnect and misunderstanding on these emotions if ever felt. The concept is wholly alien to an entity who only sees motion, knows truths at random, and believe any act on the body is reversible (and that is true! there are no permanent consequences for entities in this humanoid form).

Some may choose to disregard them as something not understandable, some may ignore it thinking it is nothing substantial. Or some may not even possess the capability even in their humanoid form.

So while it is possible human form entities can be inherently kind, it is not the norm.
