1. Are you sure you don't want the MonstaRollerX? It is wayyy cooler that whatever this is.

2. I told you a million times now. No. That joke of a shoe can burn for all I know.

3. Come on, yes it's pretty much a joke but owning one could really make you the cool kid in the circle.

4. Like I'm not already one? Everyone and their mother knows my name. Some joke pair of skates will do nothing.

5. Alright, but at least get something else that's not this.

6. This baby? No no this one's perfect.

7. Look. This one's practically out of date. No boosters, no grippy wheels, no trainer attachments, and it looks clunky. Besides, the model is very different from what you're used to. You'd have to relearn everything from scratch!! Isn't your model a Slipknot Rotate? There are other models like it the shelf over--

8. Slipknot's great and all, but I do want this kind of skates. I really don't mind learning it all over again. And best of all, I can switch the wheels and detach the sole part to use as a normal shoe! I can also get the other kind of wheeler sole FyreRace sells to practice. And it got LED lights!

9. Alright, then at least get the newer version. It's literally that but with padded soles and cushions. Holy hell does your feet need it.
