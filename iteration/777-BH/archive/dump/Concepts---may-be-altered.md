sometimes i look at my AUs folder and wonder: why is it like this man  
  
CASSIAN

- Cassian represents the void

- Himself a humanoid shadow in physicality.

- He is the 阴 to Vitus's 阳

- the adoration of stars and all things light. like speckled dust on the dark body

- cynical and nihilistic

    - (actual cynic in a way he rejects most things man. it is very easy when you aren't actually human)

- blind; recognises things through texture and heat. (...it's why he likes most things light. they give off heat)

- his mask covers the area of his face that is a bit freaky

    - think biblically accurate angel but on that sect of his face

VITUS

- Vitus represents the abundance

    - aka void of light -> black shadow, abundance of light -> white light

- He is... pearly white (Cassian's opposite in physicality)

- Adores the grim dark and the cold unknown.

- hedonistic and frivolous

    - and a cocky nonce

- eyes are basically a very big pupil. effectively photosensitive to the point of extreme pain. (will cover his eyes; p useless if all he sees is white)

- also biblically accurate angel parts on the opposite side of Cassian. He does nor hide them.

  
BOTH

- body marks of the opposite color.

- their interests oppose their namesake

- relationship: "twins"

- cassian used to have long ass hair but got cut off after a fight with vitus

- both effectively blind but can sense eachother very well. vitus is very hot, cassian is very cold.

- are they gods? legends? probably.

  
DULY NOTE:

- this AU is... pretty much rated gen

- except for the potential violence

- im thinking of talking about some philosophical points but idfk

#### On Cassian and Vitus

- this could be largely slice-of-life-ey
- These 2 dumbasses exist in an idk plane and can interact with the human world. sort of.
- they are not human
- they don't need human stuff
- what they do when interacting with the world is seamlessly create a copy of an item in their plane and interact with the copy
- pseudo 4th dimension typa thing but its like an overlay instead of an acc 4th dimension
- funny if they can go against time tho
- ppl can see them thru 6th sense in their ethereal forms
- they can choose to have human bodies in the real world but they'd have human traits and cravings. Only this time they can see! Somewhat. Cass has cataracts (very blurry and dim) and Vi has photo-phobia (he wears sunglasses)



Pros of being unmentioned: They can exist in any universe and things will still make sense (no scripture mentions the existence or nonexistence of these 2)

Cons: No hold over ppl fr



##### POWERS

CASSIAN: Call of the void

- Marks a person -> speeds up death by worldly means

- E.g. Cass marks teacher on bus (mark can only be seen by those on other-plane-and-beyond) -> within the week a school shooting happens -> 50% survival rate (what is initially planned to be a success ends up a fail due to the mark altering fate's plans)

- E.g. mark on a mother giving birth -> needs to either sacrifice baby or sacrifice mother for one cannot live if the other does -> mother chose to sacrifice herself even if initially she is planning on sacrificing the kid

- or she dies in operation

  
VITUS: ...

- ...

##### FIGHTING STYLE

- Both are long ranged with occasional sneak attacks

- Cass uses his formerly long ass hair as ribbons

- Vi uses his spear as a bo stick sometimes. spear is kinda unique too

- Cass is mostly defensive, Vi is offensive

- Cass only marks when necessary (destruction) and usually evades + sneak attack

- Vi spam creates traps + explosives

- Vi doesn't care about maiming (he can fix it after), Cass tries to not maim (self explanatory)



#### On the fused and the separated

  
why the fusion... split?

(each number is a separate entity/seperate version w diff character)  


1. it's lonely out there

2. things got boring

3. it's hard to manage

4. extremely unstable fusion

  
why the individuals fuse  


1. why the fuck not

2. promise of higher power

3. codependency

4. practicality

5. one doesn't want to continue being

6. one manipulated the other into submission



#### Potential lore

Cass gets attached to a kid

Kid can see cass and vi. both assume it due to human sixth sense. they are somewhat incorrect

prev iter of vi? managed to be involved in creating a person under XXX family, thus carrying an itty bitty trait of being able to see certain beings

prev iters of vi and cass may not reside in the world with that family thus some generations don't experience the phenomena. so much so the info doesn't get passed down much.

this attachment with little dude may be key to the legend they are planning on imparting b4 fusing tgt

!!! CHAR BIOA FOR UnVale  
  
VITUS  
  
\- Embodiment of abundance and light

\- personality wise, kind of cocky and spontaneous

\- Chaotic.  
Vitus is pretty carefree and cunning in most cases. Quite trigger-happy and impulsive, but can sit down and play the long-con if absolutely have to. Fairly blunt and harsh with words but will absolutely shower you with compliments if absoluyely deserved.  
  
(By default he is some form of energy and he gets to decide his own form. Definitely not human or any form of biological creature.)

  
CASSIAN  
  
\- Embodiment of void and shadows

\- personality wise, more reserved and cautious

\- Lawful neutral. ish.  
Cassian contrasts Vitus with how he's more reserved and thoughtful. More cautious and prefers thinking before action (only it gets bad under stress; he is so prone to overthinking). Cassian is honest (like Vitus) but more tactful in approach.  
  
(By default he is some form of energy and he gets to decide his own form. Definitely not human or any form of biological creature.)



### 06/01/25

  
Wait, this is an exercise of futility  
  
they try to leave an impact so they can be remembered by years to come, but humans are mortal and different iterations of C and V may be in different "Earths", so the stuff they leave behind will be largely ineffective.  
  
No matter how much they leave behind in different "Earths", they can't go to infinity. There will be at least 1 universe out there they haven't touched on. It's a doomed cycle, you end it or you don't.  
  
Besides, even if they left something in hopes the next iteration finds it, who's to say they know it's by them? For all they know, these are just random deeds by different legends?  
  
How do you even imprint yourself as a legend unless you yourself become a cult leader. Wait. Oh fuck.

Oh, and human OCs, aka the ... FAMILY LINE (name tbd)  
  
and this is probably going to take place in UK? idk lol

Need somewhere with both Latin roots and speak Eng idk

- Kid's the first person to see the pair, Vi interacts w the kid like a confused child.

- they were in their shadow form

- kid's energy is probably all over the place. surprisingly energetic and hyper (family line is... funky given the effects of their prev iter bleeding into their biology)

- they were like ??? what??? so Vi, surprised at the anomaly, went to the kid.

- Coincidentally their eyes is staring right at the kid

- Kid is Weirdly fascinated. Both stayed for a bit while Kid tries to persuade their friends of their existence to no avail.

- Neither of the 2 hear Kid's ramblings but oh well. Curious.

- For a bit they kind of just track the kid, sensing their energy pathways just tk know the extent of their difference.

- Knowing that the kid's a being on Earth they made it their subgoal to have a physical form to get to know the kid

- in some fashion, one of them suggest it'd be a good way to leave an impact to ensure they don't just disappear into nothing.

- eventually they meet the kid. wholesome times. and then the father.

- father's distrustful, getting stupid eeries vibes (he also has the blood)

- also he is a bit depressed? and an alcoholic? (channeling dadwright here lmao) (he's trying) and uber skeptical so man's stressed af

- Doesn't Help that the two are just all around weird. Like Clearly they are not human.

- Oh and the guy has trauma after seeing one of their failed attempts at biological manufacturing

- oh and since the biological manufacturing is uncontained excess energy of some form, cass can immediately destroy it to restore balance and no one is none the wiser

- safe for the guy who happened to pass by an alleyway, felt immense heat and buzz, felt sick, saw strewn over white pulsing muck vaguely shaped like a deformed heart, stomach, guts, then a black hole sort of appears, wipes them away, and left behind a split second of coldness

- this man is not necessarily terrified, but rather bewildered

- then it happened again, only this time they used a corpse and tried to have it come back alive. this man saw a dead body pulsing and wriggling, and glowing. oh. and it exploded. guts flying everywhere

- and again. only this time they understood some of the body systems so they are able to make the body sit. only it's like starting to rigor motis thing so it's kinda stiff. Oh and they displaced a shoulder trying to move itm Oh and they cracked the neck by turning it 180.

- the next time they tried to test the limits of the human body, thus testing mortality. it did not end well. dumb ways to die people. they still are part of the body but bones are broken. human can't work unless they fix bone. they dont know how and decided to find different human body

- man is scared shitless. so many times. it's weird how suit keeos happening to him ngl.

- Also note about the Cass and Vi, they are part of the total energy equilibrium. Like energy is conserved means the world has a fixed amount of energy???? idfk it's kinda weird.

- Vi creates things by modifying the energy threads around him, ususlly taking excess heat or light energy bc that's the easiest. (taking away heat also shifts the temperature but people... don't notice? they shrug it off as spirits or just weird sensitivity. and the sudden heat in a different place is also ignored funnily enough).

- Creating a human body... the first few attempts Vi tries to modify surrounding energy and it works? But in some of the attempts Vi slipped in some excess energy disturbing the equilibrium, so Cass must destroy the excess. (the excess leads to body explode, sudden heatwave, buzzing, movement, force, etc)

- Cass also is able to displace energy. While Vi uses energy to create/tangle together a shape to displace, Cass dismantles the shape/detangles it to displace. Otherwise it's create + destroy excess energy for equilibria

WE HAVE NAMES!!!

Elijah and Isabella Leicester  
Also I'm giving Bella a friend: Andrea Miller!

- considered of the lower socioeconomic status.

- her family and her have been scraping by with mostly junk food and donations from food drives (which is not so much unfortunately)

- she built up cholestrol over the years, similar to her family.

- her parents worked as waitress (mum) and line cook (dad) so they had enough to suppirt themselves and a small kid before

- though the restaurant closed down and mum fell sick... so homelessness it is (Andrea was 6)

- And that's when they resorted to cheap meals and drinks that hopefully be enough calories to last the entire day (resorting to fast food with high fat and calories. they eat at least once every 2-3 days for fat stores. or that's how dad reasoned it)

- Mum is in the hospital (free health care) but funds are not enough to fund their lifestyle beyond everyday meals, filling up gas in their car, and perhaps Andrea's education up until end of grade school.

- they have a run down car (hand-me-down) that still works. they live there for shelter.

- they used the gym for the bathrooms, but since they don't have a pass/membership they can't use the machines

- Andrea did 3 years of former schooling before moving to online courses taken in the library (while dad went to find work. He managed to find work as a dishwasher by the library; doesn't pay well but it's enough)

- She also forced herself to learn to communicate (aka asking seniors who are studying in the library; some aren't open to it but she gets lucky a few times)

- So she's strong in the theory department (a lot of memorisation and small explanations on what words mean or concepts) but weak in the writing department. She understands topics slightly but has a hard time with organising the ideas to somethinf comprehensible.

- Passed through middle school online too.

- Then high school has the whole scholarship for disadvantaged students which she signed up for and got in. She gets a stipend for her uniform and meals; she gladly shares any leftovers with dad

- It's from there she resolves to make the most of her high school: more scholarships, join competitions with monetary rewards and getting good.

- "Being overweight isn't something I'm proud of. It's a sign of mockery and the conditions we grew in. But it also does mean that we survived intact. We're still going, and it is a sign I hadn't give up. I may not like the fact I am fat, but I can take pride in the fact that I lived to see the next day."
