1. Have you heard of the story of Oedipus?

2. The Greek myth?

3. It's practically ancient. I'm surprised they have it taught in class.

4. It's not in English lit. that's for sure. No, I knew it from our Greek myths discussion last week.

5. Good. good.

6. ...

7. What do you think about fate?

8. That it's some lame excuse to avoid responsibility? Like "this is all according to fate. I cannot help it". Seems stupid.

9. It is one way to look at it. Although, one cannot help but think whether our actions are predetermined somehow. Isn't it weird how our decisions seemed to be outlined a certain way? How it seems that we are made to make certain calls to action? And that no matter what we will make that decision?

10. But that's just cause and effect, isn't it? Multiple causes and effects intermingling. Our previous acts build up upon eachother to produce this kind of "fate".

11. Is it? I suppose it may be that way... I dunno... something feels missing.

12. ...

13. ...

14. Just get to the point.

15. ...Do you think the outcome is avoidable if they hadn't listen to the prophecy?

16. You mean the king's death? Or just about everything?

17. ...

18. That... is a whole can of worms.

19. Saying it will not happen throws away the premise of the story. That all things are fated to happen a certain way and our actions will ultimately lead to this.

20. ...

21. But then people like to argue that by not encountering the prophecy, the family will have no incentive to move a certain way. Thus preventing the outcome and ridding ourselves of the story.

22. If we go by that argument then it makes it seem like the prophecy had to be shared one way or another. If not by the prophet then by some other means.

23. If that's the case then individual choice doesn't matter. The family will be influenced to make the decision one way or another.

24. But what if someone out there exists toÂ dissuade them? will the prophecy still hold? will circumstances make it so they still enact the prophecy?

25. honestly... i cannot tell. the only surefire way to conclude this is to know whether fate is real.

26. ...if fate is real... we cannot say the multiverse exists, can we?

27. i don't think we can conclude that eveb if fate doesn't exist. they are mutually exclusive.

28. ...

29. ...

30. why did you ask me this anyway

31. ahhh well....

32. it's not homework, is it?

33. ...

34. when is the essay due

35. ...tomorrow

36. oh my fucking god
