??: Hey, Bella! Have you heard of the book 1984?

Isabella: George Orwell? Yeah I heard of it. Why do you ask?

??: You seem the type to have read it at some point so I thought I'd ask about it.

Isabella: Me? Reading a banned book? What, you think I am that smart AND rebellious? Please, I'm flattered.

??: So you did not read it.

Isabella: Nope. Though I think my uncle has the book. I could lend it to you if you'd like.

??: No thanks; I have my own copy. Though I think you should give it a read. It might make things... clearer.

Isabella: Huh, alright. I'll probably just ask Andy to summarise it for me if it gets boring though.

??: ...I guess that works. Anyway, let me know if you read it. I'll go ahead and tell the others about the book.

Isabella: Kay\~
