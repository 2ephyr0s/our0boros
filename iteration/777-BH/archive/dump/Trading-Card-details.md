## BASIC INFO

- <s>set includes pseudo attack cards + 1 lim img only + nox</s>

- <s>kinda battle card elements (??) w/ unique traits</s>

    - <s>sth sth limbus co</s>

- limited symbols for ea. char in this au

    - fog/mist -> drowsy [bella]

    - electricity/lightning -> paralysis [gaia]

    - eye/observer -> insight [elijah]

    - mimic/doppelganger -> copy [andrea]

    - summoner/'fusion' -> summons [vitus]

    - destruction/'fission' -> elimination [cassian]

    - hahaha this was unintended it just looks cool

UNIQUE CHARS HAVE UNIQUE "ULT" + "S1" + "S2"

EA. CHAR HAS 2 "STRIKES" + 2 "DEFEND" (DEFAULT)  
  
Hypothetical game system would mimic battles in Morimens PVP (bit like reverse 1999 but all in all mimics morimens), only ea. player mains 2 characters,,, might change as time progresses

- Characters arranged s.t. (such that) positioning matters

CARD IDEAS (?)

- time keeper ed. (clock motifs)
- Lab Zetta (scientist, human experiments, mutations, etc)
- species reversal (humans -> entities and vice versa)
- Greek myths

- 20th century

- Bloodied orchestra

- Lovecraftian aesthetics



### TERMS

- SP: skill point; the cost to play each card, capped by 4 per turn (increases by 1 every 2 turns); strike and defense cards cost 0 SP

- AE: activation energy; ult currency

- ULT: ea. character gains X amount of AE per turn, can be accelerated by special effect cards; once 100 AE is achieved, add a copy of ULT card (no cost) to player's deck. ULT by default has the PRESERVE trait

- MIMIC: Andrea's currency; gained on use of her cards; replenishes HP... haha

- Deconstruct: destroy and rebuilt; REPLACE essentially; will return to original skills after turn ends.

- Preserve: keep the card on the next turn

- Splash dmg: X% dmg of main dmg hits adjacent characters

- Barrier: invincibility; take 0 dmg and lose 1 stack end of round

- Focus: give temporary +X dmg on attacks, +Y shield

- Pierce: damage ignores shield but not barrier (doesn't affect debuffs and is not affected by debuffs)

### CHARACTERS: SPACETIME

> Title: **Project Tau: Shifted Axes**
> 
> Themes: **Time, gears, strings, continuity, paradoxes, entropy **(oh my god i am not a physics nor chemistry student i barely passed high school physics, even less so on chemistry)

A note about passives

- in place if seasonal theme is active

- Type A: slower proper time, appears to age slower. heals over time (hp gain is split to multiple rounds), take less damage

- Type B: faster proper time, appears to age faster. larger heals (hp gain increased), DoT has higher impact on self

A note on the timestream mechanic:

Timestream can be forwards/backwards (positive or negative essentially) which provide buffs.

However realistically, a negative timestream might be a bit problematic and reality breaking so as of now we will avoid thinking about how negative timestream may be damaging all characters and how that may change up their skills.

*though that may change given time. i do not want to pass up the opportunity to fuck with theoretical physics, even if i bastardize it to hell and back.*

Terms:

- Taunt: Forces enemies to attack target

- Shadowing: Mimics the target's action after target does something (e.g. target does X dmg, character does X dmg after towards the target). Counts as a follow-up action

- Follow-up: Action is done after enemy action. Shields obtained in a follow-up is retained until the next round.

- Entropy (increasing/decreasing entropy):

    - Positive: collapsing systems; enemy attack has 5+X% (max 25) chance of missing (X = stacks), take 2X dmg at the end of round (max 30)

    - Stacks persist until end of battle

    - More below

- Sapling: 1 stack grows into a tree after 3 rounds, stunning them for one round.

- Seedling: 1 stack grows into a thorny rose after 2 rounds, dealing bleed damage and 1 stack of paralysis (no strike nor defense cards can be played)

- Invisibility: All attacks dealt and received will not be registered. Cannot be buffed or debuffed. Cannot act.

On ENTROPY:

- Card drops that manipulate entropy will be provided in narrative seeds or seasonal seeds (add entropy, crystallise entropy, redistribute entropy, etc)

- If any enemy reaches a threshold break, increase System Entropy

- First threshold is at 5 (+ or -). +/- 5th stack results in a stunned target and threshold break.

    - Upon first threshold break, enemies gain increased damage intake and increased strength.

- Second threshold is at 10 (+ or -). +/- 10th stack results in a threshold break.

    - Second break increases damage intake as well as strength

- System Entropy has 3 levels, starting from 0. Level shifts up with how many enemies break the threshold

    - lv 1: at least 1 enemy has entropy below 5

        - normal entropy effects (increased missed attacks and DoT) apply to enemies

    - lv 2: at least 1 enemy has entropy below 10.

        - normal entropy effects apply to enemies, all allies experience increased crit rate, reduce healing for all parties

    - lv 3: all enemies have entropy of at least 10

        - normal entropy effects apply to enemies, all allies experience increased crit rate, reduce healing for all parties, all parties start losing HP over time

- entropy decays by 1 after 3 rounds of not applying entropy.



ANDREA

- Ult: Gain X shield. Apply taunt on self. Attacks Y times divided equally among each enemy, each dealing (20% of total dmg received) dmg as follow-up attack. (Y is number of attacks received.)

- S1: Shadows the target. Deal X dmg as follow-up. (If target has at least one seedling and/or sapling, plant another one)

- S2: Gain 1 layer of invincibility (100% dodge), 25% chance of sleeping next round.

- Passive: type B

CASSIAN

- Ult: Deregulates entropy and atomises the target. Deals X\*Y dmg to each enemy (Y being number of stacks an enemy has) and stuns target for one round. Remove all ENTROPY stacks.

- S1: Add one stack of ENTROPY, deal X attack. Extend debuff of target for 1 round (cannot extend stun or sleep)

- S2: And 1-3 stacks of ENTROPY to target. For each stack of ENTROPY applied, deal X damage to target.

- Passive: type A

ELIJAH

- Ult: Randomly applies 2 status effects (no duplicates) on each enemy from the following: 2 stacks of weaken, 2 stack of paralysis, 2 stacks of increased dmg taken, 2 stacks of slowness. Deal X+Y dmg (Y = number of cards played in battle)

- S1: Gain 1 stack of barrier. Stun enemy for one round. Elijah cannot act for the rest of the round. If attacked, 50% of attack is reflected to attacker. (any plant that the target carries has their growth delayed by 1 round)

- S2: Shift a target attack to a different target (but not the target themselves).

- Passive: type A

GAIA

- Ult: Fires a laser dealing X penetrating dmg onto front row enemy. (Remove all plants om target. For each removed plant, deal X extra dmg) Increase gravitational pull at a singular point. Apply 2 stacks of slowness and 2 stacks of paralysis to all enemies. Enemy ultimate attacks are blocked for 1 round.

- S1: Gain invisibility for one round.

- S2: Grants X shield to all allies. Enemy attacks will be randomized (randomly attack anyone but themselves)

- Passive: type A

ISABELLA

- Ult: Mutates gravity field, accelerating seed growth. Triggers all ungrown plants (sapling/seedling) on enemies. All enemies take X dmg.

- S1: Deal X dmg and plant 1 seedling onto a select enemy

- S2: Heals X HP to the character with lowest HP, plant 1 sapling on enemy with highest HP

- Passive: type B

VITUS

- Ult: creates a phantom that exists in the next round carrying the same HP and buffs at the time of ult activation. At the start of the next turn, Vitus will 'combine' with the phantom, retaining the average HP and all buffs (e.g. Vitus has 50 HP, 20 temporary shield and a strength up. after round ends he has 30 HP and a poison status. Next round Vitus has 40 HP, 20 temporary shield, a strength up and poison status). Reset entropy on all enemies.

- S1: an ally gains increased damage reduction (for 1 round) and X shield. retain shields on the next round. If ally is attacked, attacker receives 1 stack of entropy.

- S2: apply 1-2 stacks to each enemy. Sacrifice 10% of HP. Remove debuffs from all allies. (if 3+ debuffs removed, regain 5% HP)

- Passive: type B

### Idea bank: season specific skills

#### SANITY meter

- Player starts with X sanity

    - Decreases after playing skill cards with that mechanic or getting attacked by status effects

        - add in seasonal cards in narrative seed that allows sanity manipulation

    - May increase using specific cards (buff or healing) or artifacts

        - *sanity enhancement cards will drop on narrative seeds so players can play without limited characters*

    - carries over after battle; guaranteed increase in safe zones (by how much kind of depends)

- As sanity decreases, affected skills mutate and player can gain certain buffs or debuffs

    - boosted attack, lowered healing

    - or modified sp

    - or skills now attack more times but are random

    - or player can no longer heal but instead deal more poison

- The lower the sanity, the worse their state is

    - Sweet spot is somewhere midway where buffs and debuffs are balanced

    - Lowest point is actively damaging, aka player is more likely to lose agency or drop dead

    - *at very low sanity, player gains ****1 self-destruct card**** (preserved until sanity returns back to healthier levels): ****LOSE 1 CHARACTER *(cannot play their cards, shifts SP cap)* to deal massive AOE damage and give back moderate sanity****.*

- Metric

    - Starting at 100

    - Sane (baseline): 80-100

    - Acceptable: 50-80; +30% atk , -30% heal, skills mutate

    - Close call: 20-50; Cannot target enemies, SP skill cost randomized (0-4), -55% heal, +50% atk

    - Practically insane: 10-20; Cannot target enemies, SP skill cost randomized (0-4), -70% heal, +100% atk

    - Good God Don't Die: 0-10; *Practically insane *\+ self-destruct card (see above)

#### RHYTHM

- Emphasises on combo chaining

    - attack enemies in a row, defend in a row, receive damages in a row, etc

- Buff/debuff skill card based on number of cards played per round

- Beat deafness (enemy only):

    - unaffected by 'rhythm' class buffs/debuffs (skills or status effects like ones listed below)

- Crescendo (controlled by enemy; rotation):

    - all atk skills gain increased strength (allies and enemies)

- Decrescendo (controlled by enemy; rotation):

    - all shield skills gain increased layers (allies and enemies)

- Adagio (controlled by boss after certain conditions):

    - Slowness applied to all

- Allegro (controlled by boss after certain conditions):

    - Reduced SP cost to all

- Cadenza (boss only):

    - Large temporary strength boost

    - Attack pierces enemy

- Canon (boss only):

    - Moderate AOE dmg

    - 20% chance to apply slowness

- Da Capo (boss only):

    - Return HP to previous state at end of round (undos all damage)

    - *does not remove debuffs*

- Accelerando (boss only):

    - increased temporary strength based on number of attacks

    - if boss doesn't attack this round; strength carries over until boss attacks

- Diminuendo (boss only):

    - next applied shield is halved then stack is removed

    - persist to next round

- Take the helm (Seasonal card):

    - Remove rhythm status effects

    - e.g. round enforces Cadenza, player can take the helm and remove it, thus reducing damage

- Chaining

    - Aggressive: attack 3 times in a row and gain added shield layers

        - in boss levels, triggers accelerando

    - Defensive: defend 3 times in a row and gain added strength'

        - in boss levels, triggers diminuendo

    - Absorption: Absorb 3 attacks in a row and gain X layers of counter

    - Dance: attack - defend - buff/debuff (in any order) and gain 1 SP

#### BLEED

- *blood related mechanics*

- Hemorrhage (debuff):

    - 'Unhealable bleeding'

    - target loses HP continually for X rounds

    - each round target loses more HP (aka round 1 of hemorrhage -5 HP, next round of hemorrhage is -10 HP)

        - healing (at most one time) stops escalation (aka round 1 is -5, round 2 stays -5 with healing, and repeat)

        - can keep hemorrhage at 0 if healing is done each round

    - too many hits to hemorrhage leads to Anemia on the next hit

- Anemia (debuff):

    - sleep for one round

    - typically paired with Hemorrhage so HP is usually lost as well

- Hyphema (debuff):

    - 'Blood clotting the eye'

    - Lower crit rate

    - After X rounds, add 1 layer of slowness

    - *Removed by 'resting': not playing cards of the character for 1 round*

- (primary) Immune thrombocytopenia (enemy only):

    - 'immune system attacks your platelets'

    - Enemy 'sleeps' every X rounds

    - bosses with this trait generally unleashes large AOE damage next round

- Spinal stroke (near fatal debuff):

    - Character becomes slowed for one round, paralysed for the next, stunned for the one after then finally receiving large HP loss then stack is removed

    - Can be stopped by applying healing or 'buffered' using specific cards dropped mid battle.

    - *only happens in boss fights; buffer cards added to hand routinely after first round hit*

- Bone bruise (debuff):

    - Attacking X times add one stack

    - Cannot attack for one round; stack removed upon round end

    - *essentially it goes ATTACK X TIMES -> NO ATTACK -> ATTACK X TIMES -> NO ATTACK and so on*

- Hemostasis (buff):

    - convert hemorrhage onto healing

- Pain tolerance (buff):

    - sacrifice HP to obtain ATK boost

    - neutralizes Bone bruise

#### TIME

- Events divided into 3 stages with 5 rounds each (names are sort of placeholder until I figure out better ones thematically)

    - Past: at the start of the stage, gain 1 card that reverses your HP state to one of the previous round; removes all debuffs

    - Present: at the start of the stage, gain 1 card that deals moderate AOE damage and stuns enemies for a round

    - Future at the start of the stage, gain 1 card that triggers 2x DoT damage on all enemies

    - *cards gained exhaust on use (disappear in battle) and are preserved until the end of battle*

    - *player can still end the battle early, but enemies in this seed tend to be a bit tanky.*

- Simultaneity (buff):

    - single target attacks now deal dmg to two targets (each receiving 75% dmg)

    - doesn't apply if there is only 1 target left on field

- Paradox (boss fights only; 1 time per battle):

    - state of existence and inexistence simultaneously

    - cannot fall below 1 HP

    - Upon taking lethal damage, gain immunity and half max HP.

- Timeout (neutral):

    - Cannot act, gain back 1 barrier and 25% max HP

- Timekeeper (buff; rotational):

    - rotates between characters (allies)

    - current timekeeper has moderate increase of crit rate

- Ephemera (unique mechanic for seed):

    - elite enemies drop small mini artefacts that influence gameplay

    - tend to be both positive and negative, e.g. increased SP cost for each card but increased SP limit

- 4th dimension / Minkowski space (boss only):

    - Upon taking lethal damage (and activating paradox), switch terrain to the '4th dimension'

        - 1 round buffer in between

    - Attacks are amplified on all parties

    - Attacks can be random and might miss

    - Boss is permanently strengthened

    - Boss gains counter that can be sealed/prevented for the round by debuffing the boss

- Timestream (controlled by player):

    - Forwards: Increased strength on all parties

    - Backwards: received DMG reduction on all parties

    - *card that changes timestream drops every 3 rounds*

- Years (boss only):

    - Every 4th round triggers 'leap year' where boss has increased strength which persists until it's defeated

        - essentially at 4th round, boss gains, say 5 strength that persists to round 8, and boss then gains another 5 strength making it 10, and so on

    - Player can 'turn back time' (reduce year stacks) delaying power scaling

### Main crux - Sandbox mode

- meta-narrative

    - a game emulating a sandbox system with a set map with 2-3 layers

        - players can stop at any layer and get the loot, then pick it back up next time or simply end early

            - stopping early leaves you with less loot (obviously)

            - going further down the layers give you rarer drops

- set enemies, set checkpoints, set trading spots, etc

    - frequency can be modified by player

    - locations are rng, unless player sets a numerical seed

    - sandbox system unlocks further the more rounds you play

        - start of with normal difficulty scaling parameters

        - then you can edit the number of safe zones

        - then you can modify the number of enemy zones

        - ...

    - trading spot allows you to buy/sell cards. bought cards may be general cards that synergise with a character but is not considered a character specific skill.

- example pattern:
    FORMATION AND ARTIFACTS -> BATTLE/EVENT -> SAFE ZONE -> BATTLE/EVENT -> SAFE ZONE -> BOSS -> LAYER END -> QUIT AND GET LOOT OR CONTINUE (repeat; loot accumulates)

- 6 characters. player can choose up to 3 for main deck per each layer.

    - can switch characters (and/or variants) in certain spots

    - variants are alternate dimensions of characters (copies with supernatural additions tied to character and lore)

- shift in difficulty

    - up to player. map's the same but points can be modified to include less or more stopping points. or bonus abilities. "full sandbox"

    - seed specific challenges

        - narrative seeds may block certain characters or force certain characters to play

        - non-narrative seeds may have their own clauses

- some seeds have a narrative gimmick. clues are scattered around character lore or are part of 'specific drops'

    - obtained after playing a character deck often enough

    - specific drops may clue into which seed and what to do to obtain more information on the character

    - *technically* you can unlock the rewarded scene even if you don't have access to the clues. it just renders the specific drop obsolete.

- achievements can lead to unlocking new decks and artifacts or currency

    - achievements are sometimes based on narrative

        - winning seed 777 with CASSIAN and VITUS (known to player only after player plays seed 777)

        - lose the last battle with Isabella and Andrea in the team

        - ...

        - *unlocks special art, lore or unique character artifact*

    - achievements are sometimes based on in-game feats

        - winning at highest difficulty combination

        - winning with only one character

        - winning with no healing

        - ...

        - *unlocks currency, artifacts, or character deck*

    - achievements can be a secret and not outrightly stated so in ui

        - specific card combinations

        - specific character combinations

        - survive with 1 hp

        - survive 3 times with no changes made to cards you draw, play and enemies defeated

            - might come with it's own easter egg

        - ...

        - *unlocks currency, additional dialogue*

        - *(ok wink wink nudge nudge in the form of character dialogue, additional achievement icons suddenly appearing in the goal window that can be checked, etc)*

    - bonus completionist award based on % achievements

- winning a round gives you loot and currency to spend on unlocking card decks or artifacts and upgrading system levels

    - upgrading system levels boost all artifact skills and all characters

    - in game shop contains all card decks and artifacts that players can choose to buy and equip onto characters

- the more you play with each deck, the more character lore you get

    - lore drops are random outside of specific drops (e.g. 5th drop is a clue to a seed a player can play to uncover more lore)

    - (by random lore drops, i mean the pieces of lore you get can be quite random as they spell out nonlinear moments in a character's life)

    - (pivotal moments or interconnected stories are part of 'specific drops')

- artifacts carry power ups that can be added to boost gameplay (up to 2 at a time)

    - increased sp

    - increased hand size

    - increased stats

    - additional cards

    - ...

- small player leveling up system

    - xp gain for player up to level 20

        - xp gain based on number of layers, difficulty of modifiers, achievements

    - boost in loot drops

    - each player upgrade may unlock a new option in sandbox

    - at a certain level, unlock **endless mode** with infinite layers. sort of. with reduced safe zones.

- once you obtained all decks and artifacts and loot becomes obsolete... well you probably do nothing with it

    - player cosmetics, ui themes perhaps

    - use currency to unlock deck specific 'boss level' to obtain a cut scene and a minor passive that can be toggled on and off.

- **tiny bonus: currency can be used if player died and wishes to continue**

- **goal is to survive as long as possible and reach as far down as possible**

### Additional game mode - Story mode

- players can experience cut scenes they skipped in narrative seeds

    - each narrative seed may have unique routes that unlock based on what the player accomplished

- main story is played through as the 'tutorial'. that round is unlocked as a story mode to revisit.

- you don't have to win the seed to unlock the story mode

    - player reaches however far they wish to. they will only unlock whichever cut scenes they reach

- seasonal story seeds will be listed in the story mode

    - *technically *specific characters may have specific seeds tied to their lore. but they also will clue the player on what to achieve in said seed to unlock something about the character. clearing it according to clues may unlock a special scene in story mode specific to the seed

### Additional game mode - Simulated training

- synchronous PVP

    - real time pvp

        - include which character decks,

        - logical rules (if applicable), like

            - if card x appears, play this card

            - if player does x, play this next turn

            - if ult happens, choose this action

            - at round x, do this

        - or they can forgo rules and just mix and match character decks then set a seed

    - get cosmetic drops after number of plays
