What are we even?  
  
Physically, we seem to be vastly different from any living being on earth. From complexion to senses to organs to inner mechanisms, we are devoid of that yet we have the power to mimic this mechanism. This could allow us to be more *human *but in no way we are humans.  
  
We are not merely the sum of our parts, so perhaps we still could be human if society deems so. But if we (I) negate that and say we are (I am) not human then we aren't human?  
  
We are not really biological? in a sense? We don't have blood nor DNA, we can't reproduce or grow. We can mimic growth but we are mostly stagnant. Fluctuations of power are natural, for we hypothesize  
  
that we are a culmination of excess energy. but energy can't be created or destroyed, so where is that energy coming from?  
  
if we assume that law to be true, we can't be excess energy for all energy is contained in the physical world and its lines on ours. But we exist and we can create and destroy manifestations of "energy". perhaps the law isn't true? but that throws the world and its laws into jeopardy!  
  
...  
  
other than that, do we actually evolve? were there past versions of us? we have nothing to track our evolution if it does exist... do we? in all our lifetime it is only us. two things of... something messing around without truly knowing what it is  
  
what we are doing until we did.  
  
...  
  
but maybe there were past iterations of us? and that that iteration of us affected the physical world somehow? That might've explain why the Leicester line has largely more energy than others combined, drawing our attention (and powering our attempts at "shapeshifting" from the looks of it.)  
  
In fact, are we actually creating and destroying energy (for the equilibrium's sake) or are we borrowing energy? Is it both?  
  
...  
  
Fuck.
