## Disclaimer

I, the creator, has very little clue as to what they are meant to be. Kind of kept it that way so I can translate it to characters half messing around. We're figuring it out as we go lol. Will update with more details in the future

## Shadow? form

### General traits

- They aren't tangible in the literal sense. They can interact with each other's bodies, deform them or carry them, however.

- They shapeshift; they decide on a form they like and keep it that way. It's based on comfort and how they feel. Not much aesthetic preference given they can't see in their main form.

- No body systems. How they manage to have a mind (that seems human) is unknown. (their displays of emotion are sort of superficial and projected.)

### Interactions with physical world

- they interpret energy lines (more on that later)

- people with high 6th sense could see some blobs of concentrated energy (them) that are indescribable. people of a certain family can see them as they are though.

## In human form

### Transformation

Found out in a whim. Usual shapeshifting antics but they transcend to the physical plane. In their usual state they transcend space-time I suppose.

### General traits

- Will have a mockery of a biological system containing important components in the wrong areas and different sizes. Will fail to live otherwise. (there was a lot of trial and error and so much body horror before they got it right.)

- Abides the laws of physics. I.e. they can't just dimension travel, fly, materialize objects from thin air, etc. So no powers, except for whatever the fuck is up with their body.

- Initially, they have a lot of limitations in diet, energy conserves, mobility and other stuff. Things get better once they learnt the human biology (they create better organs, basically).

- They learn more effectively as a product of having an actual brain. Oh. and emotions are real now.

### How they made the human body

(...bear with me. this gets weird?)

While they do exist in a seperate plane, the plane itself overlaps with the physical world. (well, physical worlds. they can choose which world or which "Earth" or universe. that's for later.) Note that the boundary seperating the two is quite thin

The physical world affects their plane in a way that the energy lines/threads they feel in their plane are from the world. (e.g. a person's body contains energy moving around in multiple directions, thus Vi ans Cass are able to feel that and interpret the energy flow.)

Different types of energy feel different, which is how they differentiate chemical energy and electrical energy. They use that knowledge to approximate a biological being (humans, birds, fish, plants, etc. only that they group them based on how tangled the energy lines are)

Their initial tries were tangible components transferring correct energy periodically to different areas of the "body" (think circuit board). (This is Vitus' element actually. Cassian is the undo button.) They failed since there's no container so it just looks like a jumbled mess of weirdly shaped, pulsing, crap. And some other kinks they fixed.

And so they possessed a dead body. (And worked on it)

Eventually they are able to create embellishments that are stuck onto the outer body (not just components in the inside). What that allows is cool stuff like moving tattoos, glowing eyes, a halo, fake claws that disappear when you touch them, etc.

Other knowledge is otherwise got from deciphering brain activity in their plane. I still have no idea how that works (I am working on it). That information is used to construct the brain so we get emotions, sensation and mobility, at least.

#### A bit on the first corpse they possessed

The dead body was initially a very sad, very much decaying corpse. Heart isn't beating, skin is pale, body is in rigor mortis, brain activity is essentially dead, and the likes.They did manage to imbue it with some form of life that it allows them to stay in the body and access the physical world. They cannot move much (lack of actual control) but it is enough for them to do a study on the human body.

This information is kind of useful in figuring out the human body. They tried creating replacement components for the corpse using said information as well as the "sparklines" they usually see. Let's just say after a while they managed to have something working and the body is "live".

Cannot really tell you the details on what they did other than creating a non-biological system solely based on their "energy" thing that isn't actually energy. Body ends up working, and when they repossess the corpse, things felt different. They still cannot move though so they aimed to find a more recent corpse to practice on.

And that is how they snagged their first human identity. Well they had Cassian try it out first. He's the more careful one out of the two. They kinda used the body to further try understand biological processes and everything else.

## Further information

### Even in the physical world they are still "humanoid"

- Upon achieving mastery in their creation, they basically upgraded the human body within established laws.

- The ideal body wastes no energy (more on point 4), so that happens. And somehow they can photosynthesize.

- Dumbasses are making it a competition. Cassian tries copying stuff from other beings, Vitus is making Frankenstein.

- They still have nerves (the body needs to function somewhat) but they mutate the body in a way that they cannot process pain. Thus self-mutilation and experimentation is easier.

- They also have some form of energy generator and destroyer courtesy of their respective powers. That regulates energy levels, thus the "no energy wasted".)

- Oh and they have the optimal body that could ideally win the Olympics. They don't have ID cards though. ("Hey Cass, what if we hack the system and make ourselves citizens of the land of the free" "What")

### When they shift back

- The knowledge is only fully present when they are in human form.

- They can have some remnants of information or vague details once they shift back but it's dubious.

- They go back to their plane as energies and lose their ability to fully understand more abstract concepts. Or feelings for that matter.

- Hey, but they can't die!

- Shifting back to being humanoid gets easier after time (once they know what to create and what not to). They eventually figured our how to create a brain with preexisting knowledge (or some other medium).

### Additional "quirks"

- They can "astral project" away from the bodies they "possess" and leave their "life force" onto the body they "possessed",

- They can leave impact on the physical world.

- They process and retain information differently in their original form. In human form, they have the aid of a (semi-)functioning brain allowing them to think more critically and think about abstract stuff. In their original form, they don't have that brain.

- Information they retain, process and communicate in their original form is usually simplified. They can notice stuff, experiment and learn, but details are accumulated over time and over a significantly longer time than most living beings.

- They have capacity for long term memory similar to human kind, just in worse quality and overall faster "expiration date". Thus they have a habit of leaving mementos wherever within their plane to signify information gathered and learned throughout their lifetime. This mindset carries over to when they are in the physical realm.

- *They can scare people by converting half of their physical body into man-made-horrors-beyond-recognition (or something). It's a skill they practiced over time*
