- given there always exists a real number greater than n, there must exist a coordinate space of R^m where m > n (in theory).

- an entity's abstract form destabilises as the nth dimension or the higher dimensional being slash world affects him: knowing forbidden truths, random effect of the realm, sudden instincts. this materialises in multiplying symbols and erratic control

- entities if different iterations cannot see each other in the nth dimension given the law necessitates that only entities of the current iteration may exist at a time

    - however it doesn't stop them from encountering other entities in lower dimensions. in some way, it disrupts the balance, but really, it's just them accessing forbidden knowledge that causes backlash. the world course corrects; they forget the incident; they will instinctively know not to repeat it

- every instinct saying no comes from the fact they had known what is not supposed to be known. essentially blocks are put in place. these blocks are removed once next iteration comes along.

- the rules of the nth dimension are extensive. each iteration may only get to know certain sections as chance put it. cass and vi happen to learn of the bio-spiritual aspect of descending, while zeph relies solely on mathematical principals. both are correct. both can exist as valid methods. they can seem weirdly contradictory but at that point I'll just take it and run with it.

- the nth dimension still follow math rules. somewhat.

- possessing living humans is a forbidden action for it tramples on a different realm entirely. the world shall course correct in accordance. possessing a non living entity and reanimating them is fair game however.

    - additional context: cassian and vitus' acts if possession is a bit like astral projection. something is left in the nth dimension so they can return to that dimension. but that is not their main focus; they are stuck in the human world, experiencing the world in 3d form. this restricts what they can and cannot do.

- the nth dimension can never erase the entity's existence (by turning it to (0,0,0,...,0). it can shape it and overwhelm it, yes, but the entity will be able to restore itself a la linear transformation.
