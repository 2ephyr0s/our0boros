As a general rule, whatever things false in real life will apply in this reality, for we assume that they run on a completely new set of physics than we are used to.

So please do not use this to aid your studies of any kind, especially if their based on the logic of our world.

And fuck off, Keith, for expecting realism.

## Overview

let's call this dimension the Nth dimension, where N is some arbitrarily big number (that i have no idea what), that's for sure. the dimension itself is filled with various vectors the being can sense but not see. in my notes they're called "spark lines" inspired by the idea of threads of energy but that concept is not set in stone. so for now, assume that the Nth dimension contains various shapes and vectors that regularly transform into various states but never to the zero vector. who allows for the transformations? no one knows, but all entities of that dimension are to be shaped at will by the dimension they reside in. they live in the state of permanence in a sense they cannot be truly destroyed.

while the dimension has existed for fuck knows how long, the story starts with a being. the being knows not of their purpose other than to exist. it exists wandering around in space, sometimes interacting with lower dimensions by the ability to transform linearly. it can visit other realities given the the various 3(+)-dimensional worlds exist in the 4(+)-dimensional space which is much less than N. whenever it does, it's never sentient in the human sense; it cannot think nor feel. The best it can do is simply sense the shapes near it. but then again, it faces no issue with overlapping for it knows instinctively to avoid collision. and how does it know? well that's the question. the being holds no thought no mind, so it cannot parse knowledge nor fact, yet it knows things it should ideally not know. in the end, it knows absolute truths it cannot question and acts accordingly anyway.

then again, the being's sentience is temporary. when time has ran its course, the being splits. there is no agony, there is no pain. the human who reads tis story could assign it to be lonely, but it is not. it just thinks it's time to split, and so it does. throughout the time it has transformed, it has kept its original shape and it's pseudo-sentience, yet the split forces its sentience to two. thus came the first iteration in the cycle: two entities who know the other exists. let's call one the entity of creation an the other the entity of destruction.

the cycle keeps going. the start of the second iteration involves these two beings fusing, creating a whole pseudo-sentient being that encapsulates both creation and destruction. then the second iteration splits, the third iteration entities fuse, and so on. it is an infinite loop where no iteration retains the previous' stock of knowledge nor memory, for there is nothing to keep. knowledge and memory are perhaps something of human invention, or maybe persiting throughout different sentient species, but these beings hold no brain to serve as a vault for knowledge and memory. its flashes of knowing lean more to instinct than true thought.

why creation and destruction? technically it's for dramatics and i initially planned to have the respective entities hold specific powers relating to creation and destruction. and technically those powers can exist, so we can assume these pseudo=sentient entities hold such powers, as useless as they are in isolation.

and remember how i spoke of being constantly translated into various forms? these beings are special in a sense they can control how their transformation to a degree. they can be transformed at will by the system, particularly when it destabilizes (more on that later), but more often than not, they can choose the shape they wish to transform to. this enables them to mimic the shape of the human body or any animal. it also makes it easy to have them act as puppets in the 3d world. 

and going back onto destabilization, it happens randomly for the most part. but there are few times where destabilization is not random, particularly when a "taboo" occurs. while these beings can know certain things and they know them instinctively outside their control, there are cases where they know things they should not know, or act on things that break the unsaid rules of the world, such as the existence of beings of a different iteration, or possessing a live person. in these cases, the world course corrects. it destabilizes the world for a brief moment, fixes the issue and let the world run its course the way it should. the beings are then "rewired" to avoid knowing these truths or doing certain actions.
