Key idea:

- `BUILDING # AVE-STREET, DISTRICT `

- Building numbering differ based on the district's naming conventions

- There are 4 main districts

    - Epsilon: Avenues ALPHA to ZETA

    - Iota: Avenues ETA to MU

    - Xi: Avenues NU to SIGMA

    - Phi: Avenues TAU to OMEGA

- Avenues are larger roads that branch of to smaller streets and numbered from North to South.

    - The northmost street to the left or right of the avenue is numbered 1

    - As such, streets that connect two avenues may be labeled by 2 different names. These streets tend to go by a unique name socially.
