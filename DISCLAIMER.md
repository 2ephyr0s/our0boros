- Any and all mentions of mathematics in this wiki is a bastardization of linear algebra concepts. Please don't trust it in your studies.
- Any and all mentions of biology in this wiki is written by someone who barely passed biology and has subsequently forgot everything they've learnt. They also decided to not double check any relevant processes in fear of losing their whimsy. Do not do this, nor should you trust what is written to feed your studies.
- Any and all mentions of physics and metaphysics in this wiki is a product of the author bullshitting stuff for shits and giggles. No they are not fact-checked most of the time, so unless a real theorem or framework has been cited, don't trust it.
- All of these are works of fiction. I am not claiming that any of these are real nor realistically feasible.

With all that said, whatever things false in real life will apply in this reality, for we assume that they run on a completely new set of physics than we are used to.

So fuck off, Keith, for expecting realism.
