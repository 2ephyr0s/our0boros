Cassian: Vitus?

Vitus: hm?

Cassian: What are we?

Vitus: ?

Cassian: Like, as beings. We aren't humans, of course, and all the manmade legends never spoke of beings like us... so what are we?

Vitus: ...

Cassian: ...

Vitus: You wonder too much.

Cassian: Hey! It's a valid question! Besides have you never wondered why we exist? Why we are created in the first place?

Vitus: Cass, dear. We are the embodiment of everything and nothing, where i create, you destroy. We are Gods and that is our purpose. Isn't that enough?

Cassian: If we are gods why does no one talk about us? Why aren't with revered, talked about? Why can't we do everythingÂ that we are entitled to do, just for being this symbol of the essence of living?

Vitus: ...

Cassian: Why are we born, really? Why are we made so fatally human when we are not and can never be? What are we? What is the truth behind our creation?

Vitus: We are never going to be the ones who hold the answers so why bother? Isn't it enough to just live? Why worry about some insane purpose when we get to be whatever the fuck we want? Live, Cass. Just live.
