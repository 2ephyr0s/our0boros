*"He... there's more people out there like him. That's what you were implying... right?"*

ARDERON said nothing; the silence thick between them. It all has lead to this, the pieces were laid out in front of her. It just took too long for her to fully see what is up.

In fact, why did it take so long for her to wake up?

No matter; there's work to do.

*"...can I ask you for a favor?"*

**PHOEBE ARDAGH: HAS THE FLAME FIZZLED OUT?**

`H. B. Murray - July 11, 2180`



Phoebe Ardagh is the city's darling, one of the renowned candidates purported to potentially bring this city to new heights. Being the eldest daughter of the Ardagh family, she has large shoes to fill. If you haven't kept up with the city's politics (shame on you!), you should know that the Ardagh family are the brains to the \*Starlight! \*program which has propelled our city forward. It's been rumored that the Ardagh princess will step up and take up the mantle as the head behind the act following her graduation!

Recently, it has been reported that the princess herself has went missing. Sources cite that she left her room at around 10 PM on the July 10, 2180 and has yet to come back. What happened that made her run away? Is it the struggle? The mounting pressure? Or is it her act of teen rebellion? Continue reading as we take a further dive into figuring out the motives for her disappearance...

*"Kid, are you sure about doing this?"*

*"Yes. If I were to start up this whole operation, I can't have my name attached to it. Too much baggage."*

*"That does mean losing out on all potential opportunities on awareness. And complete lack of safety on your end. Be smart about this."*

*"I am being smart about this. I got the funds, I have a place, and I can do by tests online and get my certifications and move on easy peasy. Besides if shit goes wrong I am pretty sure I can back myself up just fine."*

*"It's not that you little shit. You're a bloody teen! A sheltered one at that! Don't you think there are no risks involved? Cutting yourself off from society paints a massive target on your back. If not from the fringes of society, then the government itself. I have faith that you have the means to support yourself, but it means nothing if you're dead on day 1"*

*"..."*

*"Really think about it, kid. I know it's hard, and fuck do I not know it. You have a good heart and a good head. Figure out what you really want. If you think you're willing to take it, call me with this burner phone. We'll figure it out from there"*
